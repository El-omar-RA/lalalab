Sometimes when 2 kg variation are not available we may send 2 x 1kg variation bags, they are more expensive but we can send them free of charge, let us know if you do not want us to do that in order notes.A 2kg grain spawn bag generally takes longer to colonise because of its larger size. If optimum temperatures are not maintained, or if a slower-growing culture is used, colonisation may slow down further, and the bag could even run out of moisture before fully colonising.For most growers, we recommend starting with 1kg bags, unless you are confident you have a fast-growing culture.Please also note:Weight: 2kg bags are heavier, and the bottom grains may get slightly smudged due to compression. This does not affect growth.Sterilisation: To ensure sterility, 2kg bags are kept longer in the steriliser so that the core reaches 121°C.

These components offer excellent water retention with minimal nutrition. Gypsum is added for its sulfites and calcium, which supplement the mix and help keep the substrate aerated. Since mushrooms are 90% water, this substrate’s ability to absorb much water is crucial for sustaining mushrooms until the first flush. Sterilization of the substrate dramatically reduces the risk of Trichoderma contamination, a common issue for first-time growers. However, it’s important to note that contamination isn’t completely avoidable if your growing area and processes aren’t clean. Most nutrition for mushroom growth comes from grains added during inoculation, making a higher grain-to-substrate ratio beneficial for substrates like CVG. Rye is theoretically the best-suited grain for this substrate, balancing the missing nutrition, but it tends to dry out quickly and can be challenging for beginners to colonize. Millet is a more manageable alternative, offering easier handling for first-time growers. This CVG Monotub Mushroom Bulk Substrate is often called the bestMonotub Substrate.Note:Bag of coco best used asap or within 6 weeks of receiving.

One of the bases has a hole, and the other does not. When the inflatable monotub is fully inflated, you’ll notice a drainage hole. Place the black base with the hole aligned over the drainage hole, and position the solid base next to it. After this, you can add the liner.The black base not only allows proper drainage but also adds sturdiness to the tub, making it easier to move around. Previously, moving the tub could cause it to break, but with this upgrade, it’s much more durable.You can also buy the Boomer Shroomer liners or the plug and air filter individually.With a volume of 40 litres and a measurement of 48cm x 28cm x 28 cm, it is the perfect size to add 3 Kg(total weight) of spawn + substrate.The included liners make it easy to clean up and reduce the chances of side pinning. The monotub plugs are used during the colonisation stage, and the filters are used during the fruiting stage. The monotub filters allow gas exchange, which induces pinning and mushroom formation. They have ten holes, and the amount of gas exchange can be adjusted depending on the mushroom’s growth stage.This Boomer Shroomer inflatable monotub serves as a fruiting chamber for mushroom growing. Its clever design optimises fruit yield by providing an appropriate microclimate and air/gas exchange. It is the simplest monotub to set up as it only requires inflating. As some other methods suggest, making holes or painting it with spray is unnecessary.It’s advisable to purchase these tubs well before your planned growth period. Occasionally, a tub might not fill properly because of a leak. Should this happen, we’re ready to replace it quickly; contact us.Are you looking toGrowMushrooms in a Monotub or otherMycology Tools?

When the temperature of the package exceeds 40°C, the plastic wrap or wax parafilm used for sealing may melt, shrink, or otherwise be compromised due to heat. This can increase the likelihood of contamination.A bubble or condensation on any of the plates is not a cause for concern and does not affect the product’s quality.If you encounter contamination, please send us a clear photo of the affected plates, along with the number of plates affected and your order number. A refund will be issued upon verification of the issue.Please note that we are unable to offer replacements, as the same environmental conditions may lead to similar issues. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this period.Pre-poured Petri dishes Malt Extract Agar (MEA) with Anti Bacterial Compounds for mushroom growing.Yourpurchase includes– 10x Parafilm pre-cut strip– 10x 90mm Petri dish with MEA with Anti Bacterial Compounds comes sealed snugly. These plates are to be stored at room temperature. Do not store them in the fridge unless colonized.Plate Shelf Life and StorageThe optimal shelf life for plates is 30-45 days. Order plates as needed, as they cannot be stored indefinitely, even in their original packaging. While most plates can last for months, their ideal shelf life is 30 days.Usage and ContaminationPlates may remain usable beyond 30 days if uncontaminated. If contamination occurs in one plate, it doesn’t affect others in the pack. Discard contaminated plates and use the rest as normal.The presence of a bubble or condensation in any of the plates is not a cause for concern.Long-term StorageExtended storage may cause plates to lose moisture, becoming stiff and papery. Use plates only if they remain gelatinous and uncontaminated. Discard any that become stiff or papery, as they can no longer support organism growth.Refund PolicyFor damaged or contaminated plates upon delivery:•⁠ ⁠Contact us within 30 days of the ORDER date•⁠ ⁠Provide photos for refund requests•⁠ ⁠No replacements are offered; only refundsStorage GuidelinesBefore inoculation:•⁠ ⁠Store in a cool, dry place (e.g., cupboard)•⁠ ⁠Avoid refrigeration to prevent condensation•⁠ ⁠Place upside down to minimize condensationAfter colonization:•⁠ ⁠Refrigerate when at least 60% colonized•⁠ ⁠Label (date and species) and put in zip-lock bags for storage•⁠ ⁠It is best to keep it in the vegetable compartment of the fridgeRemember: The packaging sleeve is not a sterile seal. Proper storage is crucial for maintaining plate quality.About the petri dishThese dishes are made of clear polystyrene, which allows for clarity while being disposable and durable. It is easy to stock and grip and has an anti-slip ring that offers stability.General MEAG informationMEAG is a gelatinous medium that is used to purify, germinate, isolate, and manipulate mushroom mycelium to reduce the chances of contamination drastically due to its antibacterial compound.These Petri dishes are 100% ready to inoculate with spores or mushroom mycelium. Its key feature is anti-bacterial compounds. In Agar mycelium cultures, antibacterial compounds have been demonstrated to inhibit bacteria to a confinable level. In several cases, spores are infected with bacteria attached to them, and they carry it to the Agar media. This will germinate fast-growing bacterial spores that make it difficult for mushroom spores to germinate (as they are slower compared to bacterial spores).On the other hand, when infected spores are introduced to MEAG, the mushroom spores will germinate and grow, leaving behind bacterial contamination. That is because the cells composing the mycelium (Hyphae) have long and sharp filaments, which carry reduced populations (if any) when they pass through the Anti Bacterial Compounds as they grow. These plates will not prevent the growth of other contaminants that are not bacteria.We recommend MEA with Anti Bacterial Compounds forGerminating spores from a spore syringe or spore print has a likelihood of contamination.Isolating a specific strain of mushroomWild mushroom cloningPurify mycelium from other contaminated agar plates or liquid cultureMalt ExtractMalt extract contains a high concentration of maltose, which provides a suitable environment for the growth of fungi.

Have a look at ourStill Air box(SAB)GENERAL ITEM DESCRIPTIONWe use microplastic-free Unicorn Bags with this product to ensure cleaner and safer cultivationYour kits made with Unicorn grow bags, USAUnicornis the only bag in the world that has been tested byEurofins, a third party lab in Europe and passed the stringent EN 1186, and USFDA 1520 for plastic migration into the substrate (Microplastic). Unicorn PP bags was tested at the highest levels of 121 C for 3.5 hours.  No PE bags or other manufacturers’ PP bags have achieved this important food safety criteria. So rest assured you are not getting any microplastics from our kits.The bags are assured 100% contaminant-free due to their sterilization process of 3 hours at 20 psi in a commercial autoclave. Under certain circumstances, contamination can still occur, which could have occurred while the product was being shipped. In the unlikely event that you see contamination in your bag that may be due to shipping, please send us a photo within 2 weeks of receiving the item for a full refund or replacement.Your bags are made to order; please allow 2 to 3 days of handling time.We recommend that the bags are used as soon as possible to minimize the chances of contamination.Approximate weight- 1kgKEY ITEM FEATURESFruit Straight from the bag!Your kit includes:50% Reputable millet grains (Sterile and prepared at field capacity)50 % Substrate (Cow Manure+ Coco coir+vermiculite+Gypsum)Manure is directly sourced from a farm in NSW and has aged for over a yearInstructions sheet provided with every order1x Self-healing injection portAlcohol swabBag Size: 10.16cmX 7.62cmX 45.72cmFilter Size: 3.81cmX 3.81cmBrand of the bag: Unicorn (4-T)If 4-T bags are out of stock, we shall use10-T bags instead.10-T Size-12.7cmX 10.16cmX 45.72cm (Both have Inj ports).There is no need for grain-to-substrate transfer, which often leads to contamination. It essentially removes one of the most contamination-prone steps out of the mushroom growing process, saving a lot of hassle.StepsThe lower part of the bag consists of grains. Sanitize the injection port, flame the needle until red, let it cool, and then inject the grains through the injection port with 10cc Liquid culture or a completely sterile spore syringe.Once inoculated, move the bag around without shaking. This helps the liquid to move around the bag and not settle at the bottom.Keep the bag in a dry and dark spot at around 24°c on average.Check the bag in one week or two when all the grains are colonized.Simply take the bag and shake it to mix the substrate and grains together. Be careful not to strain the top of the bag, which has been heat-sealed.Keep the bag again for a week in a dry and dark spot at 24°c.Ready to fruit as per your mushroom species- Some are top fruiting, and others are side fruiting.The recommended time frame for use once received is a maximum of 2 weeks.FRUITING INSTRUCTIONSTo fruit from the side, just cut an x in the bag when fully colonized (See pictures)To fruit from the top, just cut the top part of the bag where the seal is. Please leave some space on top to create a reservoir of C02. (See pictures)Once fully colonized, these bags can be taken out of the mushroom bag and kept in afruiting chamber.",

This substrate can be used with white button mushrooms but will require a pasteurizedcasing layer.Your Options:1X 2Kg pre-sterilized Manure Substrate5X 2Kg pre-sterilized Manure Substrate10X 2Kg pre-sterilized Manure SubstrateManure substrate is an advanced option typically used by experienced growers. It is not recommended for first-time growers as it is highly nutritious, making it susceptible to various types of growth. Even though the substrate is sterile, a high grain ratio (minimum 40%) is recommended to facilitate quick colonization and reduce the chances of contamination. Millet is an excellent grain choice for manure substrate due to its slightly lower nutrition and more inoculation points than rye. For instance, 1 kg of rye might have 3000 kernels, whereas millet, being smaller, might have 8000 kernels in a kg. This higher number of inoculation points in millet allows for a more even spread and faster colonization.If you are working with our Grain spawn and do not want to use up all the spawn in one go,  inoculated a grain bag with agar or inoculated a substrate bag with grain spawn for which you had to cut open the bag but have no way to seal the bag again consider to have ourLargeSealing Bag ClipsWhy Manure Substrate?Manure is highly nutritious and is often considered the gold standard amongmonotube substrates. Its rich nutritional content makes it a superb choice for mushroom cultivation.Source and Quality of ManureWe source our manure directly from a trusted farm in New South Wales. The manure, primarily horse manure and occasionally cow manure (based on availability), is aged for over a year. This aging process is critical in preparing the manure for use as a substrate, ensuring it contains the right balance of nutrients for optimal mushroom growth.Composition of the SubstrateThe ingredients of our Manure Substrate include sterilized manure, coco coir, vermiculite, and gypsum. This blend creates a balanced environment for mushrooms, providing them with the necessary nutrients and moisture retention capabilities. The addition of coco coir and vermiculite aids in maintaining the substrate’s structure and moisture levels, while gypsum contributes to aeration and adds essential minerals.Check our Store to find otherMushroom Substrates.",

That is due to its 0.3-micron filter, which blocks all contaminants but permits the entrance and exit of oxygen and carbon dioxide (The smallest contaminants are 3 microns). This product has proven to be long-lasting and highly durable to us, it is autoclavable and widely used for grain jars and liquid cultures.Our Air filters are Hydrophobic & OleophobicSelf-healing Injection port:The self-healing Silicone Injection Port allows a needle to pass through while self-healing. It is autoclavable and long-lasting. Multiple times, we have sprayed alcohol on this product before inoculation, and it has shown no signs of deterioration. It is easy to clean and has a simple but elegant design, which homemade self-healing injection ports lack.These Injection ports can also be used on Uncle Ben’s tek.3M GlueWhat makes these items efficient and secure is the 3M strong adhesive. It can resist autoclave temperatures over 121 Celsius at 15psi for extended periods when kept covered and dry during sterilization (We have proved that it withstands higher psi; however, it is not recommended for lasting usability). We recommend keeping this jar covered with aluminium foil to avoid water/steam getting inside.There are 3M Prime pens that you can purchase and use to make a stronger adhesion between the sticker and the material. This is optional.What diameter hole to make?The overall diameter of the port is 2 cm,  perfect for a 1cm (10mm). Use aDrill Bitfor a perfect injection hole on the lid.How do you prepare the surface for Sticking?Clean the surface with analcohol swaband allow it to dry completely. It will not stick properly if you stick it on a semi-dry surface.What type of surface can I use for these?This product can be put on clean, hard surfaces, including standard metal jar lids and plastic jar lids. It is not intended for soft materials, like mushroom grow bags as per the manufacturer but we have tested it and it works on it as well. However, We Strongly recommend using plastic lids as metal jar lids corrode quickly and deteriorate. Make sure that the surface of the lid is smooth and clean and that the lid hole is not excessively large, preventing adequate adhesive from making contact with the lid.The Ball brand black plastic lids are not smooth since they feature recessed lettering moulded into the plastic. The uneven surface may affect the performance of the adhesive during sterilization runs.

    "description": "DescriptionMushroom Casing LayerThe casing layer is essential in mushroom cultivation and is predominantly used for top-fruiting varieties of mushrooms.What is a Casing Layer?A casing layer is a substrate cover designed to:Retain essential moisture.Initiate and support pinning.Prevent surface mycelium from drying out.Facilitate optimal pinset formation.Provide nutrition and trace minerals.Host microorganisms are vital for pin-set formation in some varieties.If you face challenges like side pinning or uneven pin-set on your substrate surface, our casing layer is the ideal solution. In nature, mushrooms usually form after rainfall, leveraging moist conditions and the cooling effect of moisture evaporation to induce pinning. Simulating these conditions with an apt casing layer can greatly enhance your mushroom cultivation.Types of Casing Layers:Sterilized Casing Layer: (1kg Hydrated at field capacity)Ideal for maintaining the perfect surface conditions.Best for species that prefer sterilized settings, such as top-fruiting varieties (e.g., Swordbelt, Namoeko). Some exceptions are under the pasteurized casing layer category.Reduces contamination risks in low airflow environments, like monotubs, due to its sterile nature.Our offering is ready-to-use and pre-hydrated.Pasteurized Casing Layer: (250gms dry, add 750ml boiling water to the bag directly. Creates 1 kg casing layer when hydrated.)Enriched with beneficial bacteria crucial for certain mushroom varieties.Some mushrooms need not only the ideal surface conditions but also specific bacteria for pin-set development.Designed for species like Shaggy Mane, Agaricus, and Wine Cap.Before use, add 750 boiling water to the bag and let it rest for 4-12 hours.Density of sterelised casing-Density of Casing Layer Mix:0.6 kg/L or 600 kg/m³Your Options:1X Sterilised or Pasteurised5X Sterilised or Pasteurised10X Sterilised or PasteurisedNote- When you hydrate the pasteurized casing mix, you can sterilize it if you have an autoclave and use it as a sterilized casing layer. Some species, like Almond mushrooms, may not require pasteurization or sterilization as they require the presence of heat-sensitive bacteria to fruit. For this species, add room-temperature water to the mix instead of boiling water.If you are working with our Grain spawn and do not want to use up all the spawn in one go, or inoculated a grain bag with agar, for which you had to cut open the bag but have no way to seal the bag again consider to have ourMediumSealing Bag ClipsWhich casing layer is best for me?If not growing Shaggy Mane, Agaricus, and Wine Cap, please use a sterilized casing layer.Why Choose Our Casing Layer?Proven Formula:Our casing layer blend has been refined and validated over the years.Optimal pH:Both types are adjusted to a pH of 7.5.Contamination Control:Proper airflow in your grow space is vital to ward off contamination. Our pasteurized mix uses inorganic materials and additives to minimize this risk. It also features gypsum and calcium hydroxide, enhancing nutrition and adding a pasteurizing effect. Adding a specific amount of gypsum to our mix has been proven to get rid of Trichoderma contamination drastically.Usage Guidelines:Thickness:Target a 1 cm layer.Application:Once spread, press down lightly.Timing:Only apply the casing layer after the substrate isFULLY COLONIZEDand is visibly white.Note: The enriched nutrition in our blend supports robust mushroom growth.Looking ForGrowing Mushrooms in Monotub? Check it out in our Store.If you opt against a casing layer, you can alternatively use anAtomizerto maintain substrate surface moisture(except Shaggy mane, Agaricus, and Wine cap). Ensure only small droplets form, avoiding excess water. Check regularly until the pin-set begins, then stop misting. Given the constant need for monitoring and the potential for mycelium damage, we recommend our hassle-free casing layer as the “set and forget” method.",

    "description": "DescriptionMalt Extract Yeast Agar (MYA)What is MYA?Malt Extract Agar Mix is a gelatinous medium widely used to cultivate, isolate and manipulate fungi, yeast, and moulds. It is also a method of long-term maintenance of mushroom cultures. The uses of MYA include:Germinating sporesIsolating a specific strain of mushroomGrowing mushroom mycelium for expansion into grain spawnDetermining if a liquid culture is contaminatedLong term storageWhy use Malt Extract Agar Yeast for growing mushroom culture?Malt ExtractMalt extract contains a high concentration of maltose, which provides a suitable environment for the growth of yeast and mold. That is due to its rich source of carbon, protein, and nitrogenous compounds used as energy for fungi growth.Agar-AgarAgar-Agar is extracted from various seaweeds, such as gracilaria and gelidium (It contains no animal ingredients. Due to Agar’s unique gel property and stability, it is used as a firming and thickening agent for Petri dish experimentation.)Yeast (S. Cerevisiae)The strain species S. Cerevisiae is grown on sugar beet molasses, making it a natural source of readily assimilated amino acids and proteins. For mushrooms, this means a rich supplemented diet of dietary fiber, Vitamin D, and B Complex (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12).*Please note that MYA is different from MEA. MYA includes Yeast, whilst MEA is Malt Extract and Agar only.*For More Information visit us inPre-Poured Agar Platesand become an expert.Quantity specifications:These quantities are measured based on 60*15mm size Petri dishes:The number of plates made will vary according to pouring techniques; we recommend using just enough to cover the surface of the petri dish.21 gm makes 35 Agar Plates   (Use 500ml of hot water)42 gm makes 70 Agar Plates   (Use 1000ml of hot water)63 gm makes 105 Agar Plates (Use 1500ml of hot water)84 gm makes 140 Agar Plates (Use 2000ml of hot water)168gm makes 280 Agar Plates (Use 4000ml of hot water)*Petri dish is not included.InstructionsDissolve your MYA packet in the specified ratio of hot water (i.e.1000 ml water for 42 gm of MYA) and stir thoroughly with a spoon.

That is due to methods of spore collection, preservation, and transportation (Such as spore syringes and spore prints). In several cases, when spores are infected, they carry bacteria attached to them and introduce them to the Agar media. This will result in fast-growing bacterial spores that make it difficult for mushroom spores to germinate (as they are slower than bacterial spores).On the other hand, when infected spores are introduced to MYGA (with antibacterial properties), the mushroom spores will germinate and grow, leaving behind bacterial contamination. That is because the cells composing the mycelium (Hyphae) have long and sharp filaments, which carry reduced populations (if any) of bacteria when they pass through the antibacterial properties. This antibacterial powder is an antibiotic commonly used to treat bacterial infections. In Agar mycelium cultures, it has been demonstrated to inhibit bacteria to a confinable level.The uses of MYAG with antibacterial properties includeGerminating spores from a spore syringe or spore print has a likelihood of contamination.Purify mycelium from other contaminated agar platesClone wild mushroom tissue, which has a likelihood of contaminationQuantity specifications:These quantities are measured based on 60*15mm size Petri dishes:The number of plates made will vary according to pouring techniques; we recommend using just enough to cover the surface of the petri dish.21 gm makes 35 Agar Plates   (Use 500ml of hot water)42 gm makes 70 Agar Plates   (Use 1000ml of hot water)63 gm makes 105 Agar Plates (Use 1500ml of hot water)84 gm makes 140 Agar Plates (Use 2000ml of hot water)168gm makes 280 Agar Plates (Use 4000ml of hot water)InstructionsDissolve your MYAG packet in the specified ratio of hot water (i.e.1000, ml water for 42 gm of MYAG) and stir thoroughly with a spoon.

In Agar mycelium cultures, it has been demonstrated to inhibit bacteria to a confinable level. It is used to purify, germinate, isolate, and manipulate mushroom mycelium, drastically reducing the chances of contamination due to its antibacterial compound. Its key feature is that it is autoclave resistant, making it easy for cultivators to use.How does this powder work?In several cases, spores are infected with bacteria attached to them, and they carry it to the Agar media. This will germinate fast-growing bacterial spores that make it difficult for mushroom spores to germinate (as they are slower compared to bacterial spores). Even when mushroom spores germinate, there is a high likelihood that the mycelium contains a bacterial infection, increasing the chances of contamination when transferring from Agar to grains, other agar plates, or liquid culture.On the other hand, when infected spores are introduced to an agar media with this antibacterial powder, the mushroom spores will germinate and grow, leaving behind bacterial contamination. That is because the cells composing the mycelium (Hyphae) have long and sharp filaments, which carry reduced populations (if any) when they pass through this antibacterial powder.Antibacterial powder Main Uses through agar plates-–  Used to purify contaminated Agar plates (through Agar transfer)–  Autoclave resistant (It is added in Agar mix prior to inoculation)–  Germinating spores from a spore syringe or spore print, which has a likelihood of contamination–  Clone wild mushroom tissue, which has a likelihood of contaminationInstructions for Making Agar mix with antibacterial powder mix Petri dishes–  Add  0.05g (1/20th of a gram)  of this antibacterial powder to your Agar mix  for every 42g of Agar Mix( MEA/MYA/PDA, etc.)–   Boil 1000ml of hot water ( for 42 gm of Agar mix)  and pour your antibacterial Agar mix in it–  Stir thoroughly with a spoon. The content needs to be poured slowly and not all at once.–  Autoclave or pressure cook for 20 minutes at 15 psi.–  Pour into Petri dishes when it reaches 50 degrees Celsius (Approximately hot enough to hold the flask/ jar with one hand), and let it set for 10 minutes. Do not stir the solution after taking it out of Autoclave, as this would trap air bubbles in this solution.–  Once petri dishes are set, inoculate them and wrap them with parafilm. Preferably, inoculate them after 3 days. This will ensure that there is no contamination in the agar plates.–  Petri dishes are best to be stored upside down to avoid condensation.We have relied on this mix to experiment at our lab using different varieties, and it has greatly reduced the amount of contamination we get by a large amount.Check out our other listings to addMycelium Cultures,Fully Colonized Agar Plates, andPre-Poured Agar plates.

    "description": "DescriptionPlease be advised that during the months of December through February, shipping agar plates can be particularly challenging due to environmental factors. When the temperature of the package exceeds 40°C, the plastic wrap or wax parafilm used for sealing may melt, shrink, or otherwise be compromised due to heat. This can increase the likelihood of contamination.A bubble or condensation on any of the plates is not a cause for concern and does not affect the product’s quality.If you encounter contamination, please send us a clear photo of the affected plates, along with the number of plates affected and your order number. A refund will be issued upon verification of the issue.Please note that we are unable to offer replacements, as the same environmental conditions may lead to similar issues. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this period.Potato dextrose agar (PDA) is a common culture medium used in microbiology laboratories for the cultivation and maintenance of fungi, particularly filamentous fungi and yeasts. It consists of mashed potatoes, dextrose (a type of sugar), and agar, which solidifies the medium to provide a solid surface for fungal growth.Some fungi perform exceptionally well on PDA medium as opposed to other mediums like MYPA.Potato dextrose is much lighter in color than other mediums, making it easier to notice contamination while keeping vigor.PDA plates are used for various purposes in microbiology, including:Isolation of fungi: PDA plates provide a nutrient-rich environment suitable for the growth of a wide range of fungi. Microbiologists can streak or spread samples onto PDA plates to isolate individual fungal colonies for further study or identification.Fungal identification: Fungi exhibit diverse morphological characteristics, such as colony color, texture, and growth pattern, which can be observed and recorded on PDA plates. These characteristics can aid in the identification of fungal species.Maintenance of fungal cultures: PDA plates can be used to maintain fungal cultures over time. Fungal strains can be stored on PDA plates at appropriate temperatures for future use or distribution to other laboratories.Study of fungal physiology and metabolism: PDA plates can be used to study various aspects of fungal physiology, including growth rate, sporulation, and response to environmental conditions or antifungal agents.Your order Includes:10 pre-poured, thick-poured PDA plates:Longer moisture retention for healthy mycelium growth.10 Parafilm pre-cut strips:Ensure a secure and sterile seal for your cultures.Durable 90mm petri dishes:Clear polystyrene for easy observation, disposable, and anti-slip for stability.Plate Shelf Life and StorageThe optimal shelf life for plates is 30-45 days. Order plates as needed, as they cannot be stored indefinitely, even in their original packaging. While most plates can last for months, their ideal shelf life is 30 days.Usage and ContaminationPlates may remain usable beyond 30 days if uncontaminated. If contamination occurs in one plate, it doesn’t affect others in the pack. Discard contaminated plates and use the rest as normal.The presence of a bubble or condensation in any of the plates is not a cause for concern.Long-term StorageExtended storage may cause plates to lose moisture, becoming stiff and papery. Use plates only if they remain gelatinous and uncontaminated. Discard any that become stiff or papery, as they can no longer support organism growth.Refund PolicyFor damaged or contaminated plates upon delivery:•⁠ ⁠Contact us within 30 days of the ORDER date•⁠ ⁠Provide photos for refund requests•⁠ ⁠No replacements are offered; only refundsStorage GuidelinesBefore inoculation:•⁠ ⁠Store in a cool, dry place (e.g., cupboard)•⁠ ⁠Avoid refrigeration to prevent condensation•⁠ ⁠Place upside down to minimize condensationAfter colonization:•⁠ ⁠Refrigerate when at least 60% colonized•⁠ ⁠Label (date and species) and put in zip-lock bags for storage•⁠ ⁠It is best to keep it in the vegetable compartment of the fridgeRemember: The packaging sleeve is not a sterile seal. Proper storage is crucial for maintaining plate quality.",

    "description": "DescriptionPlease be advised that during the months of December through February, shipping agar plates can be particularly challenging due to environmental factors. When the temperature of the package exceeds 40°C, the plastic wrap or wax parafilm used for sealing may melt, shrink, or otherwise be compromised due to heat. This can increase the likelihood of contamination.A bubble or condensation on any of the plates is not a cause for concern and does not affect the product’s quality.If you encounter contamination, please send us a clear photo of the affected plates, along with the number of plates affected and your order number. A refund will be issued upon verification of the issue.Please note that we are unable to offer replacements, as the same environmental conditions may lead to similar issues. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this period.Pre-poured sterile Water Agar Petri Dishes (WA) Plates with parafilm also called non-nutrient agarUses- Wild mushroom and spore cloning, isolating very bad contamination cases to grow Slime mould.Pros- Mycelium grows fairly fast compared to contamination, so it is easier to isolate themCons- Very slow-mediumEach mushroom has unique genetics; capturing its best attributes is a simple but valuable skill. If you have encountered a wild mushroom or are in love with a specific strain, these dishes are your best tool. WA is an efficient medium for mushroom tissue propagation. That is due to its low nutrient value, which reduces the chances of other contaminants from thriving. On the other hand, mushroom tissues will colonize the medium under the right procedures.Moreover, this product is a powerful and simple educational tool for learning cloning techniques. We believe that cloning mushrooms is simpler than growing them. We encourage beginners to experiment with common mushrooms from the supermarket, such as the Portobello / White Button species, to learn to clone. In this way, when growing or foraging mushrooms, this skill will come in handy. We recommend using at least 5 WA plates for cloning the desired tissue. This will help purification and increase the chances of success.Your purchase includes:Your choice of quantity of 10 WA Petri dishes.10x Alcohol wipe10x Parafilm pre-cut stripsDetailed Cloning instructions (Including the best part of mushroom flesh to use for maximum success).Plate Shelf Life and StorageThe optimal shelf life for plates is 30-45 days. Order plates as needed, as they cannot be stored indefinitely, even in their original packaging. While most plates can last for months, their ideal shelf life is 30 days.Usage and ContaminationPlates may remain usable beyond 30 days if uncontaminated. If contamination occurs in one plate, it doesn’t affect others in the pack. Discard contaminated plates and use the rest as normal.The presence of a bubble or condensation in any of the plates is not a cause for concern.Long-term StorageExtended storage may cause plates to lose moisture, becoming stiff and papery. Use plates only if they remain gelatinous and uncontaminated. Discard any that become stiff or papery, as they can no longer support organism growth.Refund PolicyFor damaged or contaminated plates upon delivery:•⁠ ⁠Contact us within 30 days of the ORDER date•⁠ ⁠Provide photos for refund requests•⁠ ⁠No replacements are offered; only refundsStorage GuidelinesBefore inoculation:•⁠ ⁠Store in a cool, dry place (e.g., cupboard)•⁠ ⁠Avoid refrigeration to prevent condensation•⁠ ⁠Place upside down to minimize condensationAfter colonization:•⁠ ⁠Refrigerate when at least 60% colonized•⁠ ⁠Label (date and species) and put in zip-lock bags for storage•⁠ ⁠It is best to keep it in the vegetable compartment of the fridgeRemember: The packaging sleeve is not a sterile seal. Proper storage is crucial for maintaining plate quality.About the petri dish-These dishes are made of clear polystyrene, allowing clarity while being disposable and durable. It is easy to stock and grip and has an anti-slip ring that offers stability.Agar Plate features90mm diameter100% contamination-free due to our laboratory-grade sterile procedures.Ingredients: Agar-agar, water.Pre-sealed to avoid contaminationAgar-AgarAgar-Agar is extracted from various seaweeds, such as gracilaria and gelidium (It contains no animal ingredients.

We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Humidity: Keep 85–95% humidity for strong pinset formation. Mist 2–3 times daily.Light: Pink Oysters need indirect light for colour developmentAir: Ensure gentle airflow to remove CO₂Pink Oyster Mushroom Grow Kit – Grow Delicious Mushrooms In Your HomePink Oysters(Pleurotus djamor) are known for their incredibly fast colonisation and fruiting cycle, making them one of the quickest species to cultivate. Their vibrant pink hue, which is most intense in young mushrooms, fades significantly when cooked. The “bacon” or “ham” like flavour is most pronounced when they are cooked until crispy. If cooked lightly, they present a milder, woody flavour and a tender, succulent texture.The 18°C to 30°C range is their ideal fruiting temperature. The mycelium itself can often tolerate slightly higher temperatures during colonisation. This makes them exceptionally well-suited for indoor growing during summer months or in regions with consistently warm climates, where other mushroom varieties like Blue Oysters might struggle.Beyond the antioxidants mentioned, Pink Oyster mushrooms are a good source of B vitamins (like niacin and riboflavin) and minerals such as potassium and iron. They are also studied for their potential cholesterol-lowering properties due to the presence of lovastatin, a naturally occurring statin.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT-Check the fruiting temperature when you buy a kit and ensure you can provide it with the temperature it needs.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Pink Oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?Do NOT wait to fruit a Pink oyster mushrooms, they dont do well in the fridge, fruit them straight after colonisation and eat the fruits after harvest pretty quickly too..Step 2 – Time to FruitIt’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!Follow these three simple steps (summarised from above):1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3. Harvest:Mushrooms usually appear within 5–7 days, Twist and pull them gently at the base.More Than One Harvest?Yes! Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to avoidPink oyster mushrooms are sensitive to their surroundings, and failing to provide the right conditions is a primary source of problems.Temperature Troubles: These mushrooms thrive in warmer temperatures, typically between  18-30°C.  Temperatures that are too low can stall growth, while excessive heat can dry them out or encourage contamination.Humidity Hurdles: Maintaining high humidity, especially during the pinning and fruiting stages, is crucial. Insufficient humidity will lead to small, dry, and cracked mushroom caps. A common mistake is not misting the growing substrate frequently enough, especially in dry climates.The Air You Breathe (or Don’t): Oyster mushrooms require a good amount of fresh air exchange. A build-up of carbon dioxide in the growing environment will result in mushrooms with long, stringy stems and small caps, a clear sign of oxygen deprivation.Light Levels: While they don’t need direct sunlight, which can be harmful, complete darkness is also not ideal. Pink oyster mushrooms benefit from indirect, ambient light to develop their characteristic vibrant colour and proper cap formation.Orientation:Pink oyster will always yield more if grown as side fruiting instead of top fruiting.💡TipIf your Pink Oyster starts growing with a pink hue, great job! That means conditions are ideal. The pink colour is normal and will fade to white as the mushroom matures.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a 10cm “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

    "description": "DescriptionPLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASINGBest for people who has steriliser and can reuse the jarsGenuine Ball jars 1 Liter, Filled 60% with a grain of your choice (Organic Rye berries or Millet). Sterilized to field capacity and ready to use, Gypsum and Calcium Carbonate were added as supplements.Each jar is filled with 400-450 gms grains (Wet).The plastic lid contains an injection port and air filter vent and is also reusable like the jar. Both Jar and Lid are autoclavable and reusable.Use an injection port to inject spores or liquid culture anywhere from 5 ml to 10 ml. The air vent filter is for gaseous exchange.Every mycelium Colonizes at around 22-24° C and each mycelium has its fruiting temperature.Both Rye and Millet will support the growth of every fungus that people normally grow. Some may prefer one of another but we do not have a guide on which species prefers which grains, if you want to experiment, please buy a mix. (Just leave a note for us to send a mix of rye and millet).Rye is more nutritious whereas millet has more inoculation points to reduce contamination risk. If you want to know morewhich grain is the best, please view this article.To seeGrain Bagsgo to our store and check them outSTORAGEDo not leave your jars inside a cupboard for colonization for storage before inoculation is fine. They need to sit somewhere with fresh airflow but away from direct sunlight or direct airflow while mycelium is colonizing the grains. Do not store unused jars inside the fridge. Only fully colonized jars can go inside the fridge to slow down the growth of the mycelium. Prioritize airflow over darkness.Use within 2 weeks of dispatch. The grains will last one month in shipment but it’s advisable to use them as soon as possible. Condensation in the Jar after postage is normal. Please shake the jar thoroughly to redistribute moisture.CONTAMINATION AND BREAKAGE POLICYIf you receive these jars contaminated, we can only refund you $5 per jar and cannot replace it. The jars are checked for leakage and monitored for sterilization, most of the time contamination happens due to contaminated liquid culture spore syringe or agar.If you open these jars to inoculate with agar and the jar is contaminated we cannot refund you. We recommend after receiving these jars, store them in a cool dry spot away from direct sunlight or direct airflow for up to 2 weeks(Never in the fridge) and contact us if they are contaminated during that time. Once the jars are inoculated, it’s not possible to know the source of contamination.It is best to drop a bit of spore/liquid culture in an agar plate before inoculating these jars to check if the contamination happened due to faulty jars or liquid culture.In case some Pre-sterilized grain jars arrive broken, please get in touch with us immediately or within 72 hours of delivery; after that, we cannot help you with any complaints of breakage as this is a glass product. Please carefully inspect the jars for breakage, including any cracks that may only be visible on careful inspection. We can only refund for a broken jar. We cannot replace it unless you bring the jar back to us(Sydney Residents). We will refund $20 per jar if it’s broken.TIPS1)Be ready to move to the next step once the grain jars are fully colonized. Do not leave your grains inside the jar for long; otherwise, they will harden and become a rigid rock and will be impossible to take out. If that happens, do not try to break the content of the jar by hitting with the palm of your other hand in case the jar shatters.2)When reusing the jar and lid, please do not fill your jar more than 60-70%. We need the headspace for gaseous exchange. Both jars and lids are autoclavable.3)Please do not open the jar lid, as the contents will no longer remain sterile. Only open them after full colonization.4)If your jar is contaminated, do not throw it or the lid away. Empty the contents outside in the bin or the garden and wash the jar and the lid with hot water and soap or bleach. The lid, injection port, and air filter are reusable. You can also replace them after every use if you want.5)While shaking the jar once or twice can speed up the growth, do not overdo it. It is recommended to shake once at 30% and again at 90%. Shaking at 90% is an absolute must to ensure even colonization.6)Please remember to label your jar with the species of inoculation, the date, and the type of grain, as the grain type may not be visible after full colonization unless it is broken up.7)Apart from using these Jars for grains, they can also be used tomake Liquid culture.SAFETYDo not bang the glass jar on your opposite hand to break the clumps; the glass may break and pierce your arms. Instead, heat it on a soft surface like a couch or wrapped-up towel.",

    "description": "DescriptionCheck out all the different varieties oflog dowel plug spawnon offer.True Reishi, scientifically known as Ganoderma lucidum, is not permitted for import or sale in Australia. However, there is a native variety of Ganoderma found in Queensland, which is also considered medicinal and is the closest alternative to true Reishi. This local Ganoderma can be grown as either conks or antlers, depending on the environmental conditions. Higher CO2 levels encourage antler growth, while increased fresh air exchange leads to the formation of conks. Antlers do not produce spores, but if they are grown in a high CO2 environment and later exposed to more air, conks will form on top of the antlers and begin to release spores. Reishi mushrooms are prolific spore producers, so it’s recommended to fruit them inside bags in a high CO2 environment. Although conks are often associated with medicinal benefits, antlers also possess the same therapeutic properties. Reishi is known for its rapid colonization and is commonly used in the production of myco-materials.100pcs Log Plugs for Native Australian Reishi .Native Australian Reishi(Ganoderma steyaertanum)-Medicinal| Also known as bracket fungus | Fruiting temp: 23°-25°CSize of dowel 8*25mmWe sell the right size ofdowel inoculation drill bitin our store for these, or buy ourdowel inoculation kit.Get everything you need forGrow Mushroom on Logs.

Please also watch our video.About This KitWe sellglass sterilised jars, but they areonly available for pickupfrom ourMarrickville store. If you don’t live nearby, this kit is the perfect fit for you.This kit is designedfor beginnerswithno prior experience in mycology or equipment. You only need aliquid culture syringe(either purchased from us or another supplier) and aclean and still workspace.IMPORTANT:This kit is designed to expand liquid culture by a factor of 10. Do you have one syringe from a supplier?Now with this, it’s 10 syringes in about 10 days.Youcannotuse it to expand spore syringes — it ishighly discourageddue to therisk of contamination.Spore Syringe vs Liquid CultureAliquid culture (LC)syringe contains white, jellyfish-likemyceliumsuspended in nutrient liquid.Aspore syringecontainsspores, which appear as brown specks (visible or not). While expanding a spore syringe is technically possible,we strongly advise against it. Spores arenot guaranteed to be sterile, so contamination is likely to occur.Testing Your CultureYou should test your starting culture to ensure it’s clean.Addone dropof your liquid culture to theMEA cup(included in the kit) and wait at least5 days.Ifonly white myceliumgrows, your culture is clean.If any discolouration appears, it’s contaminated.What’s Included in the KitItem125 ml Jar250 ml Jar500 ml Jar1000 ml JarSterile Nutrient Liquid Culture2x 50ml4x 50ml8x 50ml16x 50mlDisposable Sterile Syringes11x 10ml21x 10ml21x 20ml41x 20mlDisposable Sterile Needles (18G)25454585Syringe Caps10202040MEA Test Cup1111Marble1111Alcohol Spray Bottle11111x Sterile jar with marble⚠️Do not open this jar!, Do not open the jar as its pre sterilised.MEA (Malt Extract Agar) test cup.We highly recommend to order 1 extra MEA cup, one to test the liquid culture from yiur supplier, and one to test the liquid culture once its expanded.Before You StartWork in aclean environmentWash your handsWearglovesand amask(recommended)Use thealcohol sprayto clean the injection port and any surfacesStep-by-Step Instructions1.Prepare the Sterile JarIMP-Do not open the jarSpray theblack injection porton the jar withalcoholandwait 30 seconds.Inject all the nutrient liquidfrom the syringe we provided into the jar through the injection black port.2.Inoculate the JarRespray the injection port with alcohol. Wait 30 seconds.Inject theentire 10ml liquid culture syringeinto the jar(That you got from us or another supplier). It may work with even 1ml, but the more starting culture, the better. 10ml is recommended as it provides a perfect expansion ratio. You can use more than 10ml, but avoid using less than 10ml.❗Do NOT mix two different syringes, even if they are the same strain.Label the jar with thestrain and the date.3.Incubate the JarLeave the jar undisturbed.After5–10 days, gentlyshake the jarto distribute the mycelium. The marble helps break up clumps.4.Test the CultureSpray the injection port with alcohol.Take anew sterile syringe and needle.Swirl the jar(don’t get the white filter wet), insert the needle through the black port, and draw1 mL of culture.If you tilt the jar to draw the liquid, ensure the white filter does not touch the liquid; if it does, it’s not a problem, but try to avoid it as much as possible.Inoculate theMEA test cupwith a few drops of the sample; do not add the entire 1 mL of liquid.Waitat least 5 days.If the plate stayswhite and clean, your expanded culture is safe. If the test did not yield clean results, there is a chance that no sterile technique was maintained or a contaminated starter culture was used. We highly recommend buying an extra Mea cup (not Meag) to test your starter liquid culture before using this kit.Dispose of theused syringe and needle safely—never reuse them.After Successful ExpansionPull liquid from the jar into new sterile syringes.Soak caps inisopropyl alcoholbefore placing them on filled syringes. Watch the video on how to do this.Label each syringe with thestrain and dateusingmasking tape(markers may rub off due to alcohol exposure).Store syringes in thefridgefor6–12 months, depending on strain.Some cultures arecold-sensitive— ask your supplier.Storage and ReuseAfter using the jar,wash it thoroughly.Keep theinjection port and air filteron the lid.Dry thoroughly andstore in a zip-lock bagin a clean, dry place. Do not store in a ziplock bag if not 100% dry.You may be able to make some more liquid culture in the microwave to reuse it.How to sterilise liquid culture in a microwave.Our plastic jar, lid, injection port, air filter, and marbles are all microwave-safe (so basically everything).Common Mistakes to Avoid❌ Reusing needles –use a new sterile needle every time❌ Skipping the test for your starting liquid culture❌ Skipping the test of your expanded culture before use❌ Using contaminated liquid culture to inoculate grain bagsTimeline SummaryOption A – Safer Route:Test your LC syringe on the MEA cup – wait5 daysIf clean, add to the jar and expand – wait10 daysTest final jar culture – wait5 daysTotal time:~20 daysOption B – Faster but Riskier Route:Skip testing, add the LC syringe directly to the jar, and wait10 daysTest final jar culture – wait5 daysTotal time:~15 daysThis Kit Does NOT Include:ExtraMEA cups– You may want to buy them to test the liquid culture you purchase.GlovesormasksGrain bagorall-in-one grow bagIf you’re anabsolute beginnerand feel unsure, we have a comprehensive instructional video available in the ‘Instructional Video’ tab.

It is crucial in promoting root formation and regulating various plant growth processes.Key Benefits of the NAA SolutionEasy to apply in tissue culture protocolsEnhances MS medium for callus initiationCommonly used in media formulations such as V-KM and Cg mediaStimulates the development of lateral and adventitious rootsIn low concentrations, it triggers auxin-like responses, including root induction, cell division, growth, and fruit setHow to Use the NAA SolutionTo prepare tissue culture media with PCT’s NAA solution, follow these steps:The first step is to prepare the liquid tissue culture medium using PCT’s MS, DKW, or another appropriate formulation for your plant species.Add sugar according to the media volume (typically 30 grams per litre), 1 ml/L of PPM, and either 3–4 g/L of gellan gum or 6–8 g/L of agar.Add the desired amount of NAA solution.Autoclave the media at 121°C and 15 psi for 20 minutes.Your culture media is now ready for use!We offer both NAA powder and solution forms of our plant growth regulators to meet different needs:Powder Form: This is the raw, solid form of the product. It offers a longer shelf life, is cost-effective, and ideal for customers who prefer to prepare their solutions at desired concentrations.Solution Form: This is a ready-to-use or ready-to-dilute liquid product version. It provides convenience and ensures consistent concentration, saving preparation time. However, it generally has a shorter shelf life and should be stored properly to maintain its effectiveness.Both forms contain the same active ingredient—the choice depends on your application preferences, storage capabilities, and handling needs.

    "description": "DescriptionUninoculated blank dowels to make your mushroom dowels for logs.What are Dowels?Dowels are grooved wooden plugs essential for creating your mushroom dowels for logs. The preparation process involves the steps below:Boiling:First, the dowels are boiled in water. They will float and start secreting sap, which appears frothy.Moisture Absorption:The dowels will begin to sink as they absorb sufficient moisture.Sterilization:Place the dowels in breathable mushroom bags, filling up to 60% of the bag’s capacity. Seal and sterilize the bags.Inoculation:After sterilization, add grain spawn of your preferred mushroom variety to the dowels and wait for colonization.The grooves in the dowels protect the mycelium during the insertion into logs. The mycelium in the grooves will start colonizing the logs, ensuring successful mushroom growth.How to Prepare DowelsUse our specially designeddrill bitfor optimal results to create holes that fit the dowels perfectly. This ensures the dowels are snug without being too tight or too loose:If the hole is too loose,The mycelium won’t spread from the dowel to the log and may dry out.The mycelium may die due to heat and friction during insertion if the hole is too tight.Can Agar and Liquid Culture be Used for Inoculation?We do not recommend using agar or liquid culture for inoculating dowels as they either take significantly longer (up to six times more)to colonizeor fail to colonize altogether. Usegrain spawn, which we offer in 100g packs, to ensure your dowels are effectively colonized for efficient inoculation.If you need to buycolonized dowelsor a dowel inoculation kit or want to visit our shopping list created for people who want togrow mushrooms on logs, feel free to browse.",

It is a more straightforward option as it removes part of the process, such as inoculation and incubation. However, doing so omits vital learning steps for anyone who wants to be an accomplished mushroom grower. For example, it is like buying a grown plant at Bunnings, which requires only watering to bloom.What are some of the steps required for this kit?Choose the species you want to grow according to your level of expertise and the location you are based in (follow the temperature range guide in the second photo)(Side fruiting varieties are more manageable than top fruiting ones).Inoculate the bag following the right sanitation procedures(introduce fungi to the bag)Incubate the bag for colonization (fungi to start spreading in the bag and start to digest the food source)Once colonized, proceed with the fruiting instructions (growing actual mushrooms)Harvest and prepare for the second flushUse your spent block as mushroom compost or disposeKeep in mindThis kit is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only. Expect a small harvest as it is just a 1 kg bag.It may require patience. The entire process takes about 45 to 60 days, sometimes longer in winter.Use the bag upon arrival. The traditional kits sold in the market can be kept in the fridge. Our bags can only be placed in the fridge once fully colonized.You dispose of time and energy to read and learn about mushrooms. It is critical to pay close attention to the instruction and safety guidelines provided.You know your current weather and can choose as per temperature guidelines and your experience level.You can provide them with care and humidity.Although spore allergies are rare, it is critical to keep your distance if you react to them.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.If you are looking for onlyLiquid CultureorGrain Spawnvisit the listings in our store.",

Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.About this KitZero maintenance kitComplete Kit: Everything you need is included.This kit uses a special Master’s Mix,  blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of organic rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.This kit uses the beloved Australian Reishi strain—Ganoderma steyaertanum—known for its glossy, woody Antlers/conk fruits. With proper airflow, you get classic bracket shapes; starve it of oxygen, and you’ll see striking antler formsLight: Requires indirect overhead light to give mushroom direction of growth.All  Ganoderma mushrooms are medicinal but most researched Ganoderma is Ganoderma lucidum, unfortunately its not allowed to be legally grown in Australia due to being marked as a pest.Reishi Mushroom Grow Kit – MedicinalGanoderma steyaertanumis a native Australian Reishi—celebrated for its shiny, lacquered conk fruit bodies and adaptability in myco-material applications. Depending on airflow and CO₂ levels, fruiting can take the form of glossy brackets or whimsical antlers. Harvested specimens are most often used for medicinal extracts, tinctures, and creative myco-material projects rather than culinary dishes. Reishi is generally only grown for medicinal purpose. They are grown, dried and powdered and tehn added intea and sipped in evening/night before sleep.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—This is an advanced fungus that needs cool, consistent humidity and excellent airflow to form proper conks rather than antlers.Step 1 – Let It Grow (3 Weeks)*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Need to Wait?If you need to wait, store them in the fridge after full colonisation. They can take 40 days from baby mushroom to fully matured mushroom, so you can leave it to fruit if you are only going away for 1-2 weeks. The mushroom will seek air and come out of the air filter if you are not careful, if they do come out they will spore everywhere. It is advisable to cut open the bag and remove the antler for drying. This bag will fruit only once.Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce colonised and ready to fruit:1.Leave the bag upright in a indirect light with no direct airflow, avoid tubs or wardrobe even if you have door slightly open or ajar. Keep it completely upright and let mushrooms inside form for about 2 months.2. Harvest:Fruiting bodies may take a few 8 weeks to appear and mature. Harvest when the mushroom have reached the top of the bag.Don’t let the fruiting body come out of white air filter patch.Multiple Forms:Higher CO₂ levels will result in antler shapes; increased fresh air encourages traditional conks.If these mushrooms are left to fruit from side, they will directly form conks. Once a conk is formed, they will sporulate .Reishi is notorios to fruit excessively, that is why we do not let them form conks and let them just form antlers inside the bag.Common Mistakes to AvoidOpening the bag:if the bag is opened indoor they will start forming conks instead of antlers and sporulate all over your home. they can spore a lot if you are not careful.What to do if pins form inside the bagReishi bags are the easiest bags to fruit as it requires 0 maintenance. We want the pins to form inside the bag, do not open the bag and let them grow unrestricted.Always keep the bag upright.Harvest the mushrooms and sun/air dry them and keep it in a airtight container with desiccants. Ensure they are completely cracker dry. Keeping a semi moist mushroom in a contianer will lead to mould.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

While sharing similarities in ease of cultivation, it boasts its own unique set of characteristics, from its vibrant appearance to its distinct flavor profile and nutritional benefits.Beyond its appealing taste and appearance, the Yellow Oyster mushroom is a nutritious food. It is a good source of B vitamins, including niacin and riboflavin, as well as minerals like potassium. Like other oyster mushrooms, it is also being explored for its potential health benefits. It contains antioxidants and compounds that may have cholesterol-lowering effects. The presence of bioactive compounds in Pleurotus species, including citrinopileatus, has led to research into their potential immunomodulatory and other medicinal properties.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT-Check the fruiting temperature when you buy a kit and ensure you can provide it with the temperature it needs.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Yellow oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month .Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Time to FruitAfter the 3-week waiting period, it’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!Follow these three simple steps (summarised from above):1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3. Harvest:Mushrooms usually appear within 5–7 days and can be harvested within 1–3 weeks. Twist and pull them gently at the base.More Than One Harvest?Yes! Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to avoidOyster mushrooms are sensitive to their surroundings, and failing to provide the right conditions is a primary source of problems.Temperature Troubles: These mushrooms thrive in warmer temperatures, typically between 65-85°F (18-29°C). Temperatures that are too low can stall growth, while excessive heat can dry them out or encourage contamination.Humidity Hurdles: Maintaining high humidity, especially during the pinning and fruiting stages, is crucial. Insufficient humidity will lead to small, dry, and cracked mushroom caps. A common mistake is not misting the growing substrate frequently enough, especially in dry climates.The Air You Breathe (or Don’t): Oyster mushrooms require a good amount of fresh air exchange. A build-up of carbon dioxide in the growing environment will result in mushrooms with long, stringy stems and small caps, a clear sign of oxygen deprivation.Light Levels: While they don’t need direct sunlight, which can be harmful, complete darkness is also not ideal. Pink oyster mushrooms benefit from indirect, ambient light to develop their characteristic vibrant color and proper cap formation.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Filling the growth medium from the correct side is essential; otherwise, the final product will not attain its intended form. Please refer to the pictures in the listing to know the correct side to fill.Additionally, it’s important to remember to make a drainage hole at the bottom of the planter.

    "description": "DescriptionThis 10g blend is exclusively focused on treating aggressive Trichoderma presence in mushroom cultivation environments, along with other common bacterial and fungal contamination types. This particular blend drastically reduces the incursion of Trichoderma on cakes—an effect that amplifies over time as fewer spores are released into the environment.This blend does not increase fruiting productivity – in fact, you will see a reduction in fresh weight somewhere between 10-30% over a healthy, non-contaminated substrate. This blend is intended for those who wish to treat Trichoderma incursion that appears during or before the first flush. Trichoderma is a nuisance to deal with, and unfortunately, severe trich incursions require severe treatments. However, this blend is 100% natural and USDA-sanctioned for use with food items, and no chemicals are utilized to drive efficacy.Just-the-Trich can be used in the following ways:Substrate Spray: Add 2G to a 1L bottle, spray your substrate when spawning in bulk, and repeat weekly. Store the bottle in a cool, shaded area away from direct sunlight.For optimal results, use the contents within 6 months. Apply at least 8–10 sprays per 400g of the material.Apply this first to grain spawn by spray bottle when transferring to the substrate or directly to the substrate when mixing it with the grain spawn.Tent Spray: This is the same as the substrate spray, except you spray the inside of your tent or fruiting chamber to proactively treat Trichoderma in the growing environment itself.",

It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of  rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.The Princess of Pearl –Pleurotus ostreatus(a.k.a. Princess Pearl)  is a vigorous, high-yielding commercial strain of pearl oyster. It produces dense, creamy-white clusters with a mild, buttery flavor and tender bite—ideal for sautés, pastas, and soups. It colonizes quickly and fruits well on straw or hardwood sawdust/Master’s Mix, making it beginner-friendly yet productive enough for small commercial setups.Humidity: Maintain ~85–90% RH; mist 2–3× daily to keep the cut surface moist.Light: Indirect light helps cap development; avoid direct sun.Air: Ensure gentle fresh-air exchange to prevent long stems/small caps.Princess of Pearl Oyster Grow Kit – Dense, Buttery ClustersThe Princess strain is selected for fast colonisation andresilient fruitingacross a broad band of cool-to-moderate temperatures. Princess of Pearl mushroom has the best pinset formation. Expect compact, neatly layered caps and thick stems that cook to a savory, buttery finish. For substrates, this strain performs on pasteurised straw or supplemented hardwood (Master’s Mix). Colonisation Temperature around 21–24 °C, Fruiting between 12–29 °C.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—Keep humidity steady and ensure gentle airflow; Princess will reward you with dense canopies and repeat flushes.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Princess of pearl oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month .Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestAfter full colonisation,It’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3.Harvest:Mushrooms typically appear in 7–10 days. Harvest when caps are starting to curl upwards, exposing their gills., twisting gently at the base.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to AvoidLow Humidity:Leads to aborted pins and cracked caps — keep the cut surface moist.High CO₂:Causes long stems and tiny caps — increase gentle airflow.Direct Sun/Heat:Dries the block and deforms caps — use indirect light.Under-supplemented Substrate:Reduces yield — Princess performs best on straw or supplemented hardwood mixes.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.About this KitComplete Kit: Everything you need is included—just mist water and follow the simple instructions.This kit uses a special Master’s Mix, a blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of organic rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Blue Pearl Oysters (P. columbinus) are prized for their striking blue caps that fade to grey as they mature. They’re among the most visually stunning oyster varieties. These mushrooms thrive in cooler fruiting conditions and produce quick, abundant cluster flushes with sweet, earthy flavor and meaty texture. They are also high in antioxidants and contain lovastatin compounds that may support healthy cholesterol levels.Humidity: Keep above 85% RH during fruiting — mist 2–3 times daily.Light: Needs indirect light to maintain color and form; avoid direct sunlight. 12 hour on and 12 hour off cycle is best.Air: High fresh air exchange is required.Storage: Store in a  paper bag in the fridge—best consumed within 3-7 days—or dry/freeze dry for longer shelf life.Blue Pearl Oyster Grow Kit – Elegant & FlavorfulPleurotus columbinus, commonly known as the Blue Pearl Oyster, stands out with its beautiful steel-blue caps and tight cluster formations. These mushrooms shine in lighter-colored dishes and salads for their unique visual appeal. When cooked, they offer firm texture and sweet oyster-like flavor with subtle umami—and even impart a bluish tint to sauces when lightly sautéed.Thriving at cool temperatures (15–20 °C), Blue Pearls are perfect for indoor and temperate climate cultivation. Their fast colonisation and fruiting make them a delight for both beginners and seasoned growers, delivering multiple harvests per kit with consistent results.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—This variety benefits from additional fresh air; ensure good ventilation to avoid long stems and thin caps.Step 1 – Let It Grow (3 Weeks)*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Let it sit like this until full white (colonised)Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month.Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised.Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce colonised, start fruiting:1. Cut:Make a 10 cm “X” or slit on side of the bag where you want the clusters to form.2. Mist:Mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and maintain humidity above 85%. Stop misting when baby mushroom start to form.3. Harvest:Mushrooms typically appear within 7–10 days. Harvest when caps still have slightly turned-under edges by gently twisting the cluster at the base.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, lightly soak (casing or block) for a few hours, then rest for a week before continuing.Common Mistakes to AvoidLow Humidity:Dry conditions lead to cracked caps and poor cluster formation.Poor Air Exchange:CO₂ buildup results in long stems and small caps.High Temperature:Above 20 °C slows fruiting and dulls the blue color.Strong Light:Direct sunlight can dry out the block and damage pins.💡Tip:To keep your fruit bodies compact and vibrant, maintain cool temperatures and fresh airflow—this preserves the gorgeous blue hue and firm structure.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Warm White Oyster mushrooms are known for their delicate, nutty flavor and creamy-white, fan-shaped caps. They thrive in warmer growing environments and are especially forgiving of temperature swings. With a quick turnaround—ready to harvest in just over a week—each kit yields approximately 1.5 lb (680 g) of fresh mushrooms with opportunities for multiple flushes.Humidity: Keep relative humidity around 80–90% during fruiting—mist 1–2 times daily.Light: Needs indirect light to encourage proper cap and cluster formation.Air: Ensure gentle airflow to prevent CO₂ buildup, which leads to elongated stems.Warm White Oyster Grow Kit –  DeliciousThe Warm White Oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus) stands out with tender texture and a pleasingly nutty flavor. It fruits in clusters that are visually elegant and culinary versatile—ideal for stir-fries, soups, and creamy pasta dishes. Unlike some oyster varieties, these adapt well to a broader temperature range, making them perfect for warm indoor environments and climates.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—This strain fruits in warmer conditions than many other oysters—check your environment before starting.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Warm white oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month.Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce colonised, begin fruiting:1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3. Harvest:Mushrooms usually appear within 7–10 days. Harvest when caps begin to flatten by gently twisting at the base.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to AvoidLow Humidity:Leads to small, deformed caps.Poor Air Exchange:Causes long stems and slim clusters.High Temperature:Above 30 °C slows growth and may spoil texture.Strong Light:Avoid direct sunlight—it dries the block and harms pinning.💡Tip:Keep the environment warm but humid with good ventilation to maximise yields and preserve flavor and texture.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily.

    "description": "DescriptionThis comprehensive 650-page book delves into the fascinating world of mycology, covering topics such as mushroom cultivation, myco-remediation, and more. Known as the ‘Mushroom Bible,’ it is a must-have for both home cultivators and anyone intrigued by the realm of fungi. Considered one of the most accessible texts on the subject, the book provides unique and up-to-date insights into the science and art of mycology.In 2006, Peter McCoy established Radical Mycology, a grassroots organization dedicated to raising awareness about the diverse ways of working with fungi for personal, societal, and ecological well-being. A decade later, McCoy published Radical Mycology to share the wealth of knowledge and skills accumulated through the organization’s global efforts to advance the science of mycology in practical applications. Challenging prevailing notions about the importance of the Fungal Kingdom, Radical Mycology convincingly explores the multitude of reasons why fungi should be recognized, respected, and embraced for the myriad gifts they offer. As a result, this book stands as one of the most comprehensive resources on mycology, delving into the science of fungi.Interwoven with insightful essays on the lessons imparted by fungi, Radical Mycology, begins by examining the unique aspects of fungal biology, the crucial ecological roles played by micro and macro fungi, techniques for accurately identifying mushrooms and mycorrhizal fungi, the significance of lichens as indicators of environmental health, and the profound influence fungi have had on the evolution of all life forms and human cultures. Equipped with this foundational knowledge, readers are then guided in their direct interaction with fungi. The book provides in-depth guidance on making potent fungal medicines, cultivating fermenting fungi for food, and low-cost mushroom cultivation using recycled materials while achieving high-quality results akin to laboratory conditions. Going beyond the limitations of other mushroom-focused books, subsequent chapters delve into regenerative natural mushroom farming—a practice heavily influenced by permaculture design principles—along with extensive information on cultivating mycorrhizal fungi and the science of myco-remediation, which involves using fungi to mitigate pollution in our homes and environment. The book concludes with profound insights into the cultural significance of fungi, including a philosophical examination of fungal growth in the design of human societies and a thorough exploration of the history of psychoactive mushrooms.Throughout this enlightening journey, McCoy shares personal and thought-provoking perspectives based on his 15 years of practical experience and study in the field. By the end, readers are equipped with the knowledge to incorporate mycology into various aspects of their lives, communities, and environments.Featuring step-by-step protocols suitable for beginners to advanced practitioners, numerous photographs, illustrations, appendices, and profiles of 100 different species, Radical Mycology serves as an invaluable reference for individuals interested in DIY or collaborative homesteading, community organizing, food security, natural medicine, grassroots bioremediation, and the evolution of human-fungal-ecological relationships. Beyond being a mere book about mushrooms, Radical Mycology is a call to form alliances with fungi in endeavours to cultivate a healthier world. With extensive references and illustrations provided by the author, this unprecedented treatise is bound to become a classic for generations to come.Check out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World",

Best fruiting temp: 23°-25°CThe colonized mushroom mycelium on agar plates would be sent when they are 60% colonized.When Reishi mushrooms are grown in environments with high CO₂ levels, they form antler-like shapes. However, increased fresh air exchange promotes the development of their characteristic conk-shaped fruiting bodies.True Reishi, scientifically known as Ganoderma lucidum, is not permitted for import or sale in Australia. However, there is a native variety of Ganoderma found in Queensland, which is also considered medicinal and is the closest alternative to true Reishi. This local Ganoderma can be grown as either conks or antlers, depending on the environmental conditions. Higher CO2 levels encourage antler growth, while increased fresh air exchange leads to the formation of conks. Antlers do not produce spores, but if they are grown in a high CO2 environment and later exposed to more air, conks will form on top of the antlers and begin to release spores. Reishi mushrooms are prolific spore producers, so it’s recommended to fruit them inside bags in a high CO2 environment. Although conks are often associated with medicinal benefits, antlers also possess the same therapeutic properties.

    "description": "DescriptionMycelium Running is a manual for the mycological rescue of the planet. That’s right- growing more mushrooms may be the best thing we can do to save the environment, and in this groundbreaking text from mushroom expert Paul Stamets, you’ll find out how.The basic science goes like this- Microscopic cells called “mycelium”–the fruit of which are mushrooms–recycle carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements as they break down plant and animal debris in the creation of rich new soil. What Stamets has discovered is that we can capitalize on mycelium’s digestive power and target it to decompose toxic wastes and pollutants (mycoremediation), catch and reduce silt from streambeds and pathogens from agricultural watersheds (mycofiltration), control insect populations (mycopesticides), and generally enhance the health of our forests and gardens (mycoforestry and myco-gardening).In this comprehensive guide, you’ll find chapters detailing each of these four exciting branches of what Stamets has coined “mycorestoration,” as well as chapters on the medicinal and nutritional properties of mushrooms, inoculation methods, log and stump culture, and species selection for various environmental purposes. Heavily referenced and beautifully illustrated, this book is destined to be a classic reference for bemushroomed generations to come.Check out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World",

This book opens the doors wide to a diverse and fascinating fungal world.”–Toby Hemenway, author of Gaia’s Garden.What would it take to grow mushrooms in space? How can mushroom cultivation help us manage, or at least make use of, invasive species such as kudzu and water hyacinth and thereby reduce dependence on herbicides? Is it possible to develop a low-cost and easy-to-implement mushroom-growing kit that would provide high-quality edible protein and bioremediation in the wake of a natural disaster? How can we advance our understanding of morel cultivation so that growers stand a better chance of success?For more than twenty years, mycology expert Tradd Cotter has been pondering these questions and conducting trials in search of the answers. In Organic Mushroom Farming and Mycoremediation, Cotter not only offers readers an in-depth exploration of best organic mushroom cultivation practices; he also shares the results of his groundbreaking research and offers myriad ways to apply your cultivation skills and further incorporate mushrooms into your life.Whether your goal is to help your community clean up industrial pollution or simply to settle down at the end of the day with a cold Reishi-infused homebrew ale.Inside, you’ll find:The Fundamentals of Mushroom CultivationInnovative Applications and Projects Using FungiBasic Laboratory Construction, Equipment, and ProceduresStarting Cultures and Spawn GenerationDetailed descriptions of over 25 different genusThe book first guides readers through an in-depth exploration of indoor and outdoor cultivation. Covered skills range from integrating wood-chip beds spawned with king Stropharia into your garden and building a “trenched raft” of hardwood logs plugged with shiitake spawn to producing oysters indoors on spent coffee grounds in a 4 4 space or on pasteurized sawdust in vertical plastic columns. For those who aspire to the self-sufficiency gained by generating and expanding spawn rather than purchasing it, Cotter offers in-depth coverage of lab techniques, including low-cost alternatives that use existing infrastructure and materials.Cotter also reports his groundbreaking research cultivating morels both indoors and out, “training” mycelium to respond to specific contaminants, and perpetuating spawn on cardboard without the use of electricity. Readers will discover information on making tinctures, powders, and mushroom-infused honey, making an antibacterial mushroom cutting board, and growing mushrooms on your old denim jeans.Geared toward readers who want to grow mushrooms without the use of pesticides, Cotter takes “organic” one step further by introducing an entirely new way of thinking―one that looks at the potential to grow mushrooms on just about anything, just about anywhere, and by anyone.“This comprehensive introduction to growing and utilizing fungi has something for all mushroom-inclined readers . . . . Both practical and passionate, Cotter offers extensive and detailed information.”–Publishers WeeklyCheck out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World",

We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Swordbelt (Pioppino / Black Poplar) is prized for its long, elegant stems and velvety brown caps with a nutty, mildly peppery flavor. It responds to a cooler induction for pinning(forming baby mushrooms). This species forms attractive clusters and holds texture well in cooking, making it a culinary favourite.Humidity: Very high during primordia, (>95%), then 80–90% RH during fruiting; mist as needed.Keep surface moist but not wet.Light: Low to moderate indirect light (500–1000 lux) to guide form — avoid direct sun.Air: Good fresh-air exchange is required to avoid oversized stems and to shape caps properly.Storage: Colonised blocks keep in fridge for upto 1 months if not fruiting straight away, do not keep partially colonised bag in the fridge; consume fresh mushrooms within a few days or dry/freeze dry for longer storage.Swordbelt (Pioppino) Grow Kit — Elegant & MeatyAgrocybe aegerita(also called Pioppino, Black Poplar, Brown Swordbelt or Poplar mushroom) prefers a distinct workflow: incubate at a warmer mycelial temperature and then induce fruiting by lowering temperature into the 10–18 °C window. Pins often appear within 2–5 days of induction and expand rapidly, most kits produce harvestable clusters about 6–10 days after pinning. This block-to-harvest speed, combined with a meaty texture and savory flavor, makes Pioppino a favourite for chefs and home growers alike.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—This species benefits from a warm colonisation phase followed by a cool, humid fruiting induction (10–18 °C) and high humidity during pinning.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Pioppino mycelium can take 2–4 weeks to fully colonise depending on substrate and room temperature — wait until the block is well colonised before fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting , you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month.Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white)Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce fully colonised, induce fruiting:1. Initiate Pinning:To trigger mushroom pinning, reduce the temperature to between 10–18 °C—this can be done by allowing cooler nighttime temperatures or by giving the bag a short cold shock in the fridge. Also, increase fresh air exchange (FAE) to signal the mycelium that it’s time to fruit.Preparing the Bag for Top Fruiting:Since this is atop-fruiting setup, you won’t be cutting slits or X’s on the sides of the bag like with side-fruiting methods. Instead, you’ll cut thetop of the bag opento expose the surface of the substrate.Here’s how:First, locate where the substrate ends inside the bag.From the top of the bag, make a straight cut all the way around, butstop about 5 cm above the substrate, leaving a ring of plastic around the top edge.This creates a “reservoir” or moisture-retaining wall that helps maintain humidity around the substrate.Maintaining Humidity:It’s critical that the surface of the substrate stays moist. Mushrooms won’t form if the substrate dries out. Aim to keep a layer of tiny water droplets on the surface at all times—this indicates proper humidity. Avoid over-spraying, as excessive water can cause contamination or hinder pin development. Since we are exposing the whole top area of the substrate, it also means more surface area for evaporation and chance of substrate surface drying out, this is why the kit is rated as Intermediate level.2. Mist:Keep primordia moist (>95% RH) initially, then maintain ~80–90% RH as mushrooms expand; mist 2–3× daily.3. Harvest:Pins appear in 2–5 days after induction; harvest 6–10 days after pinset when caps are well-formed cut or twist at the base to preserve substrate. Harvest before the caps start to curl upwards.Flushes:Expect 1 flushesTip for further flush-Soak the complete bag in water, put something heavy on top to submerge it, after 3 hours, let it sit and get rid of excess moisture, wrap with cling wrap except the top part we want it to fruit from and it will fruit again.Common Mistakes to AvoidRushing induction:Initiating fruiting before full colonisation often causes poor pinset.Poor humidity control:Pioppino needs very high RH for primordia; low humidity aborts pins (Very Important!)Insufficient airflow:Lack of fresh-air exchange can yield malformed caps and overly long stems.(Long stems are formed because mushrooms are trying to reach for air).💡Tip:Aim for a warm colonisation (22–27 °C) and then a distinct cool induction into 10–18 °C for reliable, high-quality pioppino clusters.What to do if pins form inside the bagIf the pins start to form, you are a bit late but its fine, cut the top bit off and let those pin grow to maturity,Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.When the block is completely white, put it into fruiting conditions.King Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii) are known for their thick, meaty stems and large caps, which give them a rich, savory flavor that chefs love. They grow best when temperatures stay cool and steady, with humidity carefully controlled. Unlike other oyster mushrooms that grow in clusters, King Oysters form individually as tall “trumpet” shapes or crowns, often producing very large mushrooms.The mycelium (the “roots” of the mushroom) colonises well at normal room temperatures (22–24 °C), but to make the mushrooms fruit, you need a cooler range of about 15–20 °C. Because they grow from the top of the block rather than in bunches, each block usually gives only one substantial harvests.You can try for second harvest with poor luck.Humidity: Keep ~85–95% RH during pinning, then 80–90% as fruits expand.Light: Indirect light is sufficient — avoid direct sun.Air: Good fresh-air exchange (FAE) is important; If Co2 is increased, you get smaller cap, that is the look we want to achieve as the stem is what we chase with King oysters. That is why when you top fruit, leave a bit of plastic on about 5 cm from the substrate.Storage: Keep colonised blocks refrigerated if you need to delay fruiting; harvested mushrooms are best used fresh or dried or freeze dried.King Oyster Mushroom Grow Kit – MeatyPleurotus eryngii(King Oyster / King Trumpet) is recognized for dense, long-lasting fruit bodies with excellent texture for grilling, frying, and vegan “scallops.” Fruiting usually follows a cooler induction after colonisation; pins can appear within a week of putting into fruiting if temperatures are correct, and harvestable size is typically reached in 7–14 days depending on block size and conditions.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—King Oysters like a clear colonisation phase followed by a cooler, humid fruiting induction and reliable fresh-air exchange for best form and size. Sometimes when your whole block is colonised, white fluffy mycelium on top of the block may inhibit the formation of baby mushrooms, for this reason, we scratch the surface gently with a fork. This assists in formation of pins, you are only scratching surface to remove mycelium, not damaging the surface by severe scratching. Dont let your inner cat get clawing.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for king oyster blocks can take longer (2–4 weeks) depending on  temperature — wait until the block is solidly white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month.Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce fully colonised(grown white), induce fruiting:1. Initiate Pinning:To trigger mushroom pinning, reduce the temperature to between 15–20°C. Also, increase fresh air exchange (FAE) to signal the mycelium that it’s time to fruit.Preparing the Bag for Top Fruiting:Since this is atop-fruiting setup, you won’t be cutting slits or X’s on the sides of the bag like with side-fruiting methods. Instead, you’ll cut thetop of the bag opento expose the surface of the substrate.Here’s how:First, locate where the substrate ends inside the bag.From the top of the bag, make a straight cut all the way around—butstop about 5 cm above the substrate, leaving a ring of plastic around the top edge.This creates a “reservoir” for-retaining  co2. This extra co2 is what helps us achieve the classic look of  King oyster with long thick meaty stem and small cap, its the stem that we are after for king oysters.Maintaining Humidity:It’s critical that the surface of the substrate stays moist. Mushrooms won’t form if the substrate dries out. Aim to keep a layer of tiny water droplets on the surface at all times—this indicates proper humidity. Avoid over-spraying, as excessive water can cause contamination or hinder pin development. Since we are exposing the whole top area of the substrate, it also means more surface area for evaporation and chance of substrate surface drying out, this is why the kit is rated as Intermediate level.2. Mist:Maintain humidity and mist the exposed surface 1–3 times daily as needed —Do not spray on baby mushroom when they form, there should only be tiny droplets of water at every time, not more. Do not let the surface dry otherwise it wont fruit.3.Harvest:Mushrooms typically appear in 7–10 days. Harvest when caps are starting to curl upwards, exposing their gills., twisting gently at the base.Flushes:blocks will give you one solid flush. Soaking between flushes can help recover moisture and will give you another smaller flush.Common Mistakes to AvoidStarting fruiting too early:King Oysters must be fully colonised or they will abort pins.Low Humidity:Causes small, dry crowns — maintain high RH at pinset. You should have tiny droplets of water all the time on surface otherwise mushrooms wont pin.Poor Air Exchange:Results in thin, elongated stems and poor cap formation.💡Tip:For large, restaurant-quality king oysters, use bigger, well-supplemented blocks and prioritise consistent humidity + cool fruiting temps — the texture will be worth it.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all themushroom growing kits available in our Spray and grow 3 kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Best fruiting temp: 23°-25°CThese are spawn bags and not fruiting kits to fruit directly from the bag.These are sawdust spawn to help you grow mushrooms on logs.Upon arrival, remove the bag from the box and unfold it to ensure the white filter patch is fully exposed, as this is where the mycelium breathes. Allow the bag to rest for 3–5 days in a location away from direct sunlight and airflow.Use our Sawdust spawn for substrate to substrate transfer,or to inoculate logs. it provides up to 1000 times more inoculation points than grain spawn, promising even and swifter colonization in the long run.Key Features-Lag Period:Lag period is when mycelium enconters unfamiliar food , when transferring sawdust spawn to logs, there is no lag period as you are going from wood to wood.True Reishi, scientifically known as Ganoderma lucidum, is not permitted for import or sale in Australia. However, there is a native variety of Ganoderma found in Queensland, which is also considered medicinal and is the closest alternative to true Reishi. This Native Ganoderma can be grown as either conks or antlers, depending on the environmental conditions. Higher CO2 levels encourage antler growth, while increased fresh air exchange leads to the formation of conks. Antlers do not produce spores, but if they are grown in a high CO2 environment and later exposed to more air, conks will form on top of the antlers and begin to release spores. Reishi mushrooms are prolific spore producers, so it’s recommended to fruit them inside bags in a high CO2 environment. Although conks are often associated with medicinal benefits, antlers also possess the same therapeutic properties. Reishi is known for its rapid colonization and is commonly used in the production of myco-materials.Since this listing is to grow reishi in logs, you would get conks from the logs as they are grow outside in higher airflow.Get everything you may need toGrow Mushrooms on Logsin our store.Have questions about Sawdust Spawn?

    "description": "DescriptionOrganic Cow Manure Substrate for Mushroom Cultivation-This listing is for raw, 12 months aged cow manure with no amendment. The substrate may need to be mixed with coco, vermiculite to improve water retention and sterelised before using it for indoor grow. The manure is fine to be used as fertiliser straight up  for plants .Important- We may make. aslight hole in the bag as the microbes release volatile air especially in hot weather and the bag may expand and burst, so breathability of the bag is essential as well as storage.Dark cool spot away from light.Product Description:Our Organic Cow Manure Substrate is a nutrient-rich bulk growing medium  for the high-yield indoor cultivation of dung-loving mushroom species . Sourced from organically raised cattle, this substrate provides the essential food and water source your mycelium needs to thrive.Key Features and Benefits:Cow manure is a traditional and highly effective substrate, naturally packed with the essential nitrogen, minerals, and organic compounds vital for robust mycelial colonisation and increased fruiting yields.Substrate is supposed to be prepared with materials like Coco Coir and Vermiculite (CVG) to achieve “Field Capacity”—the perfect balance of water retention and aeration necessary to prevent water logging and promote vigorous growth.Derived from cows fed organic feed, free from synthetic chemicals, pesticides, or non-organic residues, ensuring a clean and natural product for your organic cultivation needs.Outdoor Use:The naturally composted and aged manure can be used for outdoor beds.Indoor Use (Important):For controlled indoor cultivation, this substrate needs to be Sterilised using high heat and pressure (typically 15 PSI in a autoclave) to eliminate all competing molds, bacteria, and spore contaminants. This ensures your mushroom spawn (mycelium) has a clean, uncontested environment to colonise and fruit successfully.Ideal For:Mushroom cultivators seeking a highly productive, manure-based bulk substrate.Growing dung-loving species in a controlled indoor environment.Use as a high-nutrition amendment when mixing custom substrates.Directions for Indoor Use:Inoculation: In a clean, sterile environment (such as a Still Air Box or in front of a laminar flow hood), mix your fully colonised grain spawn with the sterile cow manure +Gypsum+Coco+Vermiculite substrate.Incubation: Place the mixture in a controlled environment to allow the mycelium to fully colonise the substrate.Fruiting: Introduce fruiting conditions (light, humidity, temperature) and watch your high-yield harvest begin!, typically done in a monotub like Inflatable or Max Yield tub.Safety Note: Always maintain strict sterile practices when handling, inoculating, and mixing this substrate for indoor mushroom farming to ensure success and prevent contamination.Product must be handled correctly with gloves and mask, The product may have off putting smell .Do not expose to moisture or direct sun.Designed for Experienced Indoor Mushroom GrowersThisadvanced manure substrate blendis engineered specifically forexperienced cultivatorsseekinghigh yields from dung-loving species. It offers a nutrient-rich base to support vigorous fruiting but requires precision, proper technique, and a deep understanding of substrate management.Why Choose This Blend?Whilehorse manureis our top choice due to its superior fiber content,composted cow manureserves as an excellent alternative. This formula is optimised for potency and performance, but it’snot beginner-friendlydue to its complexity and contamination risk.If using this substrate for Portobello or Almond, you may need further composting and amendments like straw.Full Recipe (Approx. 2 kg Yield):550 g– Composted Horse or Cow Manure100 g– Coco Coir140 g– Vermiculite28 g– GypsumWater:Start with1100 ml, and gradually increaseup to 1300 mlas needed to reachfield capacity.Hydration is critical:Manure varies in water content, so youmust testfor field capacity and adjust accordingly.Important Notes for Success:Higher Contamination Risk: Due to the richness of this blend, contamination is more likely. Proper sterilisation and clean handling are essential.Slower Colonisation: Nutrient density slows mycelial growth. Compensate with ahigher spawn-to-substrate ratiofor optimal colonisation speed.Not for Beginners: We strongly recommend new growers start with oursimpler CVG (Coco Coir, Vermiculite, Gypsum)monotub substrate before attempting this advanced mix.Tested with LalaLab Materials: This recipe was developed usingLalaLab’s manure and component(CVg, Gypsum and Vermiculite). Substitutions with other brand is fine but the ratio would need to be adjusted to get the correct texture, ph, hydration, So please do not follow this recipe exactly. Making the right textured substrate requires some experience.Level Up Your GrowThis high-performance substrate is perfect for cultivators ready to take their skills to the next level. With precise hydration, careful handling, and the right spawn ratio, it can yieldexceptional flushesfrom demanding species.",

To maintain a proper seal and prevent sticking or damage during use, it’s essential to lubricate the contact surfaces where the lid meets the steriliser’s body.Why Lubrication is ImportantPrevents galling or seizing of the metal surfaces.Ensures a tight and even seal during pressure cycles.Makes opening and closing the lid easier and safer.Instructions:Apply a small amount to a clean paper towel or lint-free cloth.Rub the lubricant along the top rim of the steriliser body (where it meets the lid). Also, apply a thin layer to the corresponding inner lip of the lid.Ensure the lubricant is spread evenly without clumps. A thin, even film is ideal, not excess.Use a clean paper towel to remove any visible excess, leaving just a light film.How Often to Lubricate:Every 3–5 uses or when you notice increased resistance when sealing/unsealing.Clean old residue occasionally with isopropyl alcohol before reapplying fresh lubricant.",

Unicorn PP bags was tested at the highest levels of 121 C for 3.5 hours.  No PE bags or other manufacturers’ PP bags have achieved this important food safety criteria.Lead time (mentioned in the listing above “add to cart” button) means time it takes to prepare this order. Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.About this 3kg KitComplete Kit: Everything you need is included, just spray water and follow the simple instructions.This kit uses a special Master’s Mix, a blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of  rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Snow White Oysters are celebrated for their pristine white caps, mild-sweet flavor, and firm texture. Most kits produce large, elegant clusters within 1–2 weeks and can yield 1.5kg of mushrooms per block. They’re perfect for beginners and flourish in cooler, consistent conditions.Humidity: Keep above 85% RH—mist 2–3 times daily.Light: Provide indirect light to support healthy cap development.Air: Ensure good fresh air exchange to prevent CO₂ buildup.Snow White Oyster Grow Kit – Elegant & ConsistentThe Snow White Oyster delivers flawless, bright-white clusters that are not only beautiful but incredibly versatile in the kitchen. Fruiting rapidly (1–2 weeks to first harvest), these mushrooms offer a delicate flavor and firm texture that stands up beautifully in soups, pastas, and on their own.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—Snow Whites prefer cool conditions—ensure your setup stays within 10–18 °C for best results.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Snow white oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks fro the dat eof inoculation mentioned on the label-depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month .Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce colonised, begin fruiting:1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3. Harvest:Mushrooms appear within 1–2 weeks. Harvest when caps are flat by gently twisting at the base.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water ( by exposing the cut portion to the water in a bowl for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to AvoidHigh Temperatures:Going above 22 °C can slow growth and discolor caps.Low Humidity:Results in dry, split caps.Poor Air Exchange:Causes long stems and small caps.Strong Light:Direct sun can dry the block and disrupt pinning.💡Tip:Keep the environment cool, humid, and ventilated to preserve those snow-white clusters and tasty texture.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.What do mushrooms need to grow healthyPrimary requirement -Mushrooms require high humidity, proper temperature(each mushrooms have their own preferred temperature as mentioned above) and airflow (not direct).Secondary requirement-some overhead light or ambient light( No direct sunlight). They also need a clean area to grow in.If the place you are trying to grow in like a garage is dirty or very windy, the block may contaminate with competing organisms.Mushrooms are sensitive to these conditions and may not grow, grow deformed or not grow at all or worse contaminate.Spore warningAll mushrooms to propagate produce spores. Some people may be allergic to spores, so be cautious where you grow them and with experience you would know the correct time to harvest them so they do not sporulate.Harvesting earlier as teh caps start to flatten will help you avoid the spores.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.About this 3kg KitComplete Kit: Everything you need is included just mist water and follow the simple instructions.This kit uses a special Master’s Mix, a blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of organic rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.Blue Shimeji is a commercial Pleurotus strain selected for small, shimeji-style fruit bodies: tight clusters, long slender stems and small, metallic-blue caps when harvested young. It colonises quickly and is prized for fast turnarounds and reliable, repeatable flushes , great for both beginners and small-scale producers.Humidity: Keep 85–92% RH during pinning and fruiting; mist 2–3 times dailyLight: Indirect light is sufficient — avoid direct sun which fades the blue pigment., 12 on and 12 off full spectrum white light is best.Air: Strong fresh-air exchange is important to keep caps compact (CO₂ suppression causes long stems).Blue Shimeji Grow Kit – Fast and beautifulBlue Shimeji (Pleurotus ostreatus) produces tightly packed clusters of small, firm mushrooms with a metallic-blue sheen when young that fades to steel-grey as they mature. They’re appreciated for firm texture and a clean, sweet oyster flavour that holds up when cooked. Fruiting is rapid once conditions are right — expect visible pins within days and harvest windows in about 5–10 days after moving to fruiting conditions.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT—Use cooler, well-ventilated conditions to maintain the blue color and compact form.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Blue shimeji oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month.Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce fully colonised:It’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3.Harvest:Mushrooms typically appear in 7–10 days. Harvest when caps are starting to curl upwards, exposing their gills., twisting gently at the base.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growth.Common Mistakes to AvoidToo Warm:Higher temps (>21 °C) speed growth but reduce blue pigmentation and can produce floppy fruiting bodies that are brown and not blue.Poor Air Exchange:Causes long stems and small caps — increase gentle ventilation.Low Humidity:Results in aborted pins and dry caps — keep humidity high.Inconsistent Light:Too little or more light can result in either white or brown pins as the pins that starts off as dark blue start to mature.💡Tip:Harvest some clusters early if you want that classic shimeji look (small cap, long stem) — leaving them longer increases cap size and reduces the blue tone.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.About this 3kg KitComplete Kit: Everything you need is included, just spray water and follow the simple instructions.This kit uses a special Master’s Mix, a blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of  rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.This hybrid variety, sometimes called theBlack Pearl King Oyster, combines the meaty texture of King Oyster with the resilience and deep-coloured caps of specialty strains.Humidity: Maintain 85–93% RH during fruiting. Mist 2–3 times daily.Light: Needs indirect light for proper cap development. Avoid direct sunlight.Air: Gentle airflow is essential.Black King Oyster Mushroom Grow Kit – Hearty & GourmetTheBlack King Oysteris a hybrid strain ofPleurotus ostreatus, famous for its thick stems, chewy texture, and umami-rich flavor. With darker caps and a robust form, these mushrooms are ideal for stir-fries, grilling, or even as a meat substitute.Unlike common Oyster mushrooms, Black King Oysters prefer cooler fruiting conditions (15°C–21°C), making them an excellent choice for indoor setups in mild climates. With the right care, each kit can yield multiple flushes totalling up to 1.3kg of fresh mushrooms.They are also valued for potential health benefits, including cholesterol-lowering properties and antioxidants that support immune health.Step-by-step Instructions & Post-Harvest CareIMPORTANT-This variety needs cooler conditions than Pink or Blue Oysters—check your environment before buying.Step 1 – Let It Grow*Take the bag out of its packaging.*Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.*Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Note:Full colonisation for Black king oyster blocks can take about 2 weeks depending on  temperature ,wait until the block is solid white before inducing fruiting.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting after full colonisation, you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month .Do not store it in the fridge until the bag is fully colonised(white).Step 2 – Fruiting & HarvestOnce colonised, It’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!1. Cut:To prepare your side-fruiting mushroom growing kit, start by cutting a 10–12 cm “X” into the plastic on the side of the block, where the substrate touches the bag. This is where the mushrooms will fruit from. After making the cut, gently press out any trapped air inside the bag. Then, take the loose, empty upper portion of the bag (since the block only fills the lower half) and fold or roll it neatly over the top of the block. Secure it in place with tape so it doesn’t hang down or cover the fruiting area. This keeps the cut area exposed to fresh air, encouraging healthy mushroom growth from the side of the block.2. Mist:Lightly mist the cut area 2–3 times daily and keep humidity high.Stop misting when the baby mushrooms tarts to come out. Constant misting is better than heavy misting.3.Harvest:Mushrooms typically appear in 7–10 days., twisting gently at the base to harvest.Flushes:Expect 2–3 flushes. After each harvest, remove all remaining fruit bodies, allow the block to rest for 3–4 days, then soak it in cold water for 2–3 hours before resuming misting to promote new growthCommon Mistakes to AvoidTemperature:Black King Oysters won’t fruit well in warm conditions. Ensure 15–21°C for best results.Humidity:Low humidity causes cracked caps and small fruit bodies. Mist frequently.Air Exchange:Poor airflow leads to long stems and tiny caps. Keep gentle ventilation.Light:Needs indirect light. Too dark = poor formation, too bright = drying.💡Tip:If mushrooms grow with long stems and tiny caps, it’s a sign of excess CO₂. Increase airflow.What to do if pins form inside the bagDon’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evaporated , this constant evaporation signals mycelium to pin.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3:Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Checkout all theMushroom Growing kits Available in Our Spray and grow 3 Kgrange.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

It explores how a history of entrenched fears and misconceptions about fungi has led to their near absence in Australian ecological consciousness and biodiversity conservation.Through the combination of engaging text and stunning photography, the author reflects on how aesthetic, sensate experience deepened by scientific knowledge offers the best chance for understanding fungi, the forest and human interactions with them.Check out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World",

AC can also darken the medium, simulating soil conditions that promote rooting and embryo development. While it may gradually release certain nutrients or plant growth regulators, its effects can vary depending on plant species and medium composition. Use in moderation and validate through testing to determine the optimal concentration for your specific culture system.*Disclaimer: Results may vary depending on species, media, and experimental conditions.

We welcome wholesale inquiries, contact us to learn more about our commercial options.GENERAL INFORMATIONMost mushroom kits on the market are grown in standard plastic bags that can leach microplastics into the substrate. At LalaLab, we do things differently. All our mushrooms are grown using Kits made with Unicorn Grow Bags (USA) — the only bags in the world that have been independently tested by Eurofins, a leading third-party laboratory in Europe.Unicorn PP bags have successfully passed the stringent EN 1186 and USFDA 1520 food-contact migration tests for plastic safety. In fact, they were tested at the toughest conditions — 121°C for 3.5 hours — and showed no plastic migration into the substrate.No PE bags or any other PP bags from other manufacturers have met this critical food-safety standard.So you can rest assured:LalaLab kits do not leach microplastics, and your mushrooms are completely safe to eat.",

Order plates as needed, as they cannot be stored indefinitely, even in their original packaging. While most plates can last for months, their ideal shelf life is 30 days.Usage and ContaminationPlates may remain usable beyond 30 days if uncontaminated. If contamination occurs in one plate, it doesn’t affect others in the pack. Discard contaminated plates and use the rest as normal.The presence of a bubble or condensation in any of the plates is not a cause for concern.Long-term StorageExtended storage may cause plates to lose moisture and become stiff and papery. Use plates only if they remain gelatinous and uncontaminated. Discard any that become stiff or papery, as they can no longer support organism growth.Refund PolicyFor damaged or contaminated plates upon delivery:•⁠ ⁠Contact us within 30 days of the ORDER date•⁠ ⁠Provide photos for refund requests•⁠ ⁠No replacements are offered; only refundsStorage GuidelinesBefore inoculation:•⁠ ⁠Store in a cool, dry place (e.g., cupboard)•⁠ ⁠Avoid refrigeration to prevent condensation•⁠ ⁠Place upside down to minimize condensationAfter colonization:•⁠ ⁠Refrigerate when at least 60% colonized•⁠ ⁠Label (date and species) and put in zip-lock bags for storage•⁠ ⁠It is best to keep it in the vegetable compartment of the fridgeRemember: The packaging sleeve is not a sterile seal. Proper storage is crucial for maintaining plate quality.About the petri dish-These dishes are made of clear polystyrene, which allows for clarity while being disposable and durable. They are easy to stock and grip and have an anti-slip ring that offers stability.General MEA petri dish information-MEA is a gelatinous medium to purify, germinate, isolate, and manipulate mushroom mycelium.These petri dishes are 100% ready to inoculate with spores or mushroom mycelium.We recommend MEA plates forGerminating sporesIsolating a specific strain of mushroomSchool projects to grow bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses (We have a separate listing for a school project kit on our eBay store)These plates are treated with UVC light, significantly reducing contamination chances.Malt ExtractMalt extract contains a high concentration of maltose, which provides a suitable environment for fungi’s growth. It is also a rich source of carbon, protein, and nitrogenous compounds, which are used as energy for fungi’s growth.Agar-AgarAgar-Agar is extracted from various seaweeds, such as gracilaria and gelidium (It contains no animal ingredients. Due to Agar’s unique gel property and stability, it is used as a firming and thickening agent for Petri dish experimentation.)You can also buyAnti-bacterial Agar Platesfrom our store or other pre-madeAgar mixesto make your agar plates.Please be advised that shipping agar plates from December through February can be particularly challenging due to environmental factors. When the package temperature exceeds 40°C, the plastic wrap or wax parafilm used for sealing may melt, shrink, or otherwise be compromised by heat, increasing the likelihood of contamination.If you encounter contamination, please send us a clear photo of the affected plates, the number of plates affected and your order number. We will issue a refund.Please note that we cannot offer replacements, as the same environmental conditions may lead to similar issues.",

Please ensure that the silicone seal remains properly seated when closing the lid, as it may occasionally shift or fall out. A quick visual inspection before closing will help prevent any issues. Theinjection port and air filter on these lids are replaceable. Just applyprimerand replace the injection port and air filter as required, depending on use. It is a great idea to tilt the jar and check for leakage before and after adding it to the steriliser. If the leakage is from the injection port or the air filter, press it down firmly for 5-10 seconds, and it will do the job.Tip-The air filter and injection port will get immense pressure from the water that’s changing to steam in the steriliser. We let the jars sterilise and cool down. Before taking them out, we make a gentle push on the air filter and injection port for them to stick back if they came loose.Will your lids fit all Mason jars?Our lids are designed to fit mason jars labeled as Regular Mouth (70mm) or Wide Mouth (86mm). These are standard sizes, and they will fit popular branded jars like Ball, Kerr, Aussie Mason etc.However, please note that non-branded jars from stores like Big W, Kmart, or Coles may not be the same size and our lids may not fit them.Before purchasing, we recommend ordering a single lid to test the fit. You can also check your jar’s size by visiting the the website of the retailer where you purchased your jars or planning on purchasing the jar and confirming whether your jars are labeled Regular Mouth or Wide Mouth.This way, you can be sure our lids will work with your jars.Save time and effort from drilling holes on Mason Jar lids. These Lab-class mason jar lids are designed specifically forliquid cultureandgrain spawncultivation. The wide mouth lid includes a Microppose injection port and a micron air filter.

    "description": "DescriptionMushroom Slants for long-term mushroom culture/ mycelium storage 2+ yearsThis is the best method to store mushroom culture for the long term. We have used these to store our culture in our lab and now we bring this awesome product to professionals and beginners. The slants are called so because the agar is cooled down at an angle giving it the maximum surface area for the mycelium to grow. We have slants with wood and without wood. We use premium birch wood with the most premium borosilicate bottles available. These bottles can be reused and are autoclave-friendly.YOUR PURCHASE INCLUDES-1x or 10x 50ml Borosilicate Bottlewith nutrient-rich agar with or without birch wood, sealed withParafilm.One strip of parafilm extra.The birch wood option is suitable for hardwood-loving mycelium, which gives it a fibrous to colonize, keeping the mycelium active and preventing enzyme blindness. The hardwood option can still be chosen for non-wood decomposing species.These bottles have a flat surface on the bottom to stay upright without needing a rack to store them.The agar culture is made using a complex mixture of nutrients, including grain water, peptone, MEA, yeast, and potato water from freshly boiled potatoes.The complex nutrient is abundant with a very thick layer of pour, this guarantees the agar not drying out and has enough moisture for the mycelium to survive long term.The introduction of hardwood also makes mycelium vigorous and makes it used to the ultimate medium or substrate it will be transferred to.A Petri dish is a short-term storage method as the culture dries out because of the large surface area and is mainly used to propagate mushrooms.Find ourPre-Poured Petri Dishesin our Store.These slants have a screw lid that can be closed at 95% and seal the lid with parafilm for easy breathability, keeping the mycelium alive for many years. We use glass bottles instead of standard plastic bottles as they have clearer visibility and a premium look. The glass can be reused and is autoclave-safe. The lid is also autoclavable.These slants have been professionally made in a very sterile environment after years of practice to get it right and have been modified in the process.Advantage-– Does not take up much space.– Creates a mother culture for long-term storage– 50ml with 2 options- with or without wood.– More nutrients and exposure to different mediums, the more viable your culture is going to be.– The screw-top design prevents mycelium from drying out and has a low opening to prevent moisture from escaping in the long term.Instructions to use:-– When you buy a culture from a supplier like us, grow it in a petri dish, take a small piece of the culture from the leading edge of the petri dish, and place it in your slants in a still air box or in front of a flow hood.– Within a few days, the mycelium will start colonizing your slant; when you see the whole slant is covered with white mycelium without contamination, the culture can be stored inside the fridge at around 5 to 8 degrees.– It is advisable to get the culture out of dormancy once every 2 years and repeat the process above to keep the mycelium viable. It is not a necessary step but it assures viability. On orders of 10+ slants, we can also design your own preferred medium, like Potato Dextrose, Peptone, Yeast and activated charcoal (PDYPA). Check this recipe out in our PDYPA agar plate listing.Easy refund policyIf you are unsatisfied with the quality of our products, we will replace them or provide you with a refund.

We also recommend you buyBiodegradable MEA agar cupsfor those testing liquid cultures or spore syringes before inoculating their bags. Do you need a sterile workspace? Have a look at ourStill Air box(SAB)The liquid culture can be used in various cultivation techniques. You may introduce the liquid culture into sterilized grain jars/bags, agar Petri dishes, or even another nutrient Sterile jar to expand into more liquid culture.Storage instructions are mentioned on the storage tab.Lion’s Mane behaves differently from other mushroom species in liquid culture. Its mycelium is thin, wispy, and slow-growing, so it rarely forms dense clouds throughout the solution. Instead, it settles near the bottom or floats in delicate strands, and typically only colonises 30–40% of the liquid before slowing down or lightly browning. This is a normal part of its life cycle and does not indicate poor quality or contamination. The syringe still contains the correct concentration of healthy, active culture suspended in nutrient solution, ready to grow once introduced to grain or substrate.Do you want to try these liquid cultures and grow your own mushrooms?

    "description": "DescriptionThe kit described is an XL-size monotub designed for professional or commercial use in mushroom cultivation. It includes several components:Watch video in the video tab for full instruction.1 Black Base: The foundation of the tub where the substrate and spawn are placed.1 Bin Liner:Liners are a bit different to the one in our video due to stock issues, its shown correctly on the photos.1 Colonisation Lid: Used during the initial colonisation phase to cover the substrate.1 Fruiting Lid: This lid is available instackable or taperedvariations. The Tapered Fruiting lid helps manage moisture by directing condensation forming on the top of the lid to the sides, while the stackable fruiting lid allows for stacking multiple tubs. If you are buying multiple tubs, it’s 100% recommended to get stackable tubs.After complete colonisation, the colonisation lid is replaced by one of these fruiting lids. When swapping the colonisation lid with one of the fruiting lids, you can add a casing layer to your fully colonised tub. If you decide to use our casing, you will need a 2 kg casing layer for the tub.8 Air Filters: These are attached to the fruiting lids to facilitate air exchange while keeping contaminants out.If you’re looking for a complete growing solution, including both the monotub and substrate, we recommend checking out ourMax Yield Bins Mushroom Growing Kit with Substrate. This comprehensive option is ideal for those who want a ready-to-use setup to optimise their growing process.What do you not get with this kit?-Painter tape/duct tape/micropore tape–Grain bag,substrateandcasing.DimensionsBlack base with colonisation Lid: L x W X H : 52cm : 39 cm: 19 cmBlack base with Stackable Lid: L x W X H : 52cm : 39 cm: 30 cmBlack base with tapered Lid: L x W X H : 52cm : 39 cm: 32 cmThis monotub has a capacity of 10 kg, accommodating 2 kg of spawn and 6 kg of substrate and optionally 2 kg of casing. It is not recommended for beginners due to its large size and potential contamination loss. The tub’s robust construction is highlighted, making it durable but expensive to ship. The product is made in Canada and sold by LalaLab, the official reseller of Max Yield Bins.Instruction-1)PreparationInsert the liner in the black base, add your substrate, and then the colonised mushroom spawn in layers, finishing with a substrate layer on top. It would be best to use 2 kg of spawn and 6 kg of substrate(1:3 ratio)2) Colonisation:Close the base with a flat coloniser lid and cover the holes in the black base with painter’s or duct tape on all sides. Leave for 2 weeks. Painter’s tape(masking tape) is recommended as it does not leave residue.3)Fruiting stage:Once the mycelium has fully colonised in the tub, apply a 2 Kg casing layer on top of the substrate (optional) and change to a fruiting lid.Replace the painter’s tape or duct tape with micropore tape.If you did not use a casing layer, you must maintain surface conditions of very fine, tiny water droplets with our heavy-dutyatomiser spray. Mist as frequently as required so that the tiny droplets of water always stay on top of the surface; stop misting when the mushroom starts to come(pinset).The tub facilitates the growth of any top-fruiting mushroom. The kind of substrate you need would differ. For example, to grow oysters, Reishi, or Shiitakes, you would needHardwood sawdust and bran substrate. To grow portobello/white button/Almond agaricus mushrooms and any dung-loving mushrooms, you need ourmanure substrate. Some mushroom types may requireCoco and vermiculite substrate.Some mushrooms can’t be grown in a tub like Wine cap/White button unless, somehow, you introduce microbial activity as they need microbes in compost or casing to start fruiting. We don’t recommend growing wine caps in these tubs at all.",

Our liquid recipe is vegan.Lion’s Mane Claw ( Hericium erinaceus) Gourmet and Medicinal.Wood-loving Species. Best grown in lower temperatures(18°-22°C) but can tolerate higher temps. Fruiting temp: 18°-32°CThis mushroom liquid culture is made with the best strain we can find. It is checked every six months for its vigor and ability to fruit on a commercial scale. Each jar is tested before it is sent out. We give a 100% guarantee on our culture.The liquid culture can be used in various cultivation techniques. You may introduce the liquid culture into sterilized grain jars/bags, agar Petri dishes, or even another nutrient Sterile jar to expand into more liquid culture.Lion’s Mane behaves differently from other mushroom species in liquid culture. Its mycelium is thin, wispy, and slow-growing, so it rarely forms dense clouds throughout the solution. Instead, it settles near the bottom or floats in delicate strands, and typically only colonises 30–40% of the liquid before slowing down or lightly browning. This is a normal part of its life cycle and does not indicate poor quality or contamination. The syringe still contains the correct concentration of healthy, active culture suspended in nutrient solution, ready to grow once introduced to grain or substrate.We offerHigh-Quality Disposable GlovesandMasks, essential for maintaining sterile conditions in your mycology projects. We also recommend you buyBiodegradable MEA agar cupsfor those testing liquid cultures or spore syringes before inoculating their bags. Do you need a sterile workspace? Have a look at ourStill Air box(SAB)Storage instructions are mentioned on the storage tab.Do you want to try these liquid cultures and grow your own mushrooms? Why not try ourMushroom growing kitinstead? Our kits are very different and unique, and you will surely love them.Did you know that we sell Mushroom culture in form ofLiquid culture,Log plug dowel spawn,Agar plate,Mushroom grain spawn,Sawdust Substrateand asMushroom Growing Kits?.",

    "description": "DescriptionReady to use autoclavable liquid culture and grain spawn mason jars with injection port and air vent for mushroom cultivationSave time and effort from drilling holes on Mason Jar lids. These Lab-class mason jars are designed specifically for liquid culture, PF TEK, and grain spawn cultivation. Their wide mouth lid includes an injection port and a micron air filter. The injection port allows the needle to pass through multiple times while self-healing. The micron air filter has a vent of .22 microns, allowing the appropriate exchange of gases whilst remaining sterile. Both the filter and injection port have a strong adhesive that can withstand autoclave temperatures of over 120 Celsius (250F) at 15psi for extended periods.Your purchase includes:3x Glass Mason jar (with Marble or Magnetic Stirrer for an extra +$5 each)3x White Mason jar plastic lid- smooth, no branding, with 2 holes3x Self-healing injection port3x  Air Filter VentIf you requireOnly the Plastic Lid, our store has a different listing for it.Looking toMake Grain Spawnor YourOwn Liquid Culture?

That is due to its 0.22-micron filter, which blocks all contaminants but permits the entrance and exit of oxygen and carbon dioxide (The smallest contaminants are 3 microns). This product has proven long-lasting and highly durable; it is autoclavable and widely used for grain jars and liquid cultures.Self-healing Injection port:The self-healing Silicone Injection Port allows a needle to pass through while self-healing. It is autoclavable and long-lasting. Multiple times, we have sprayed alcohol on this product before inoculation, and it has shown no signs of deterioration. It is easy to clean and has a simple but elegant design, which homemade self-healing injection ports lack.3M Primer:What makes these items efficient and secure is the 3M strong adhesive. It can resist autoclave temperatures above 121 Celsius at 15psi for extended periods when kept covered and dry during sterilization (We have proved that it withstands higher psi; however, it is not recommended for lasting usability). We recommend keeping this jar covered with foil paper to avoid water/steam getting inside.Marble:It is used for breaking Mycelium if you don’t have a magnetic stirrer. Please be careful when using marble. Swirl it around instead of shaking it to avoid breaking the jar.Magnetic Stirrer Bar:Used to break up the Mycelium with the help of a Magnetic stirrer. More oversized bars always get thrown to the side while stirring, as most of the inexpensive magnetic stirrers have a weak magnet.Check ourMason Jars and LidsSection to see more options.",

    "description": "DescriptionHF-2L Glass Spray Dryer – High-Efficiency Laboratory Spray Drying System-THis product is shipped on a palletThe HF-2L Glass Spray Dryer is a compact, high-precision system designed for efficient spray-drying of solutions, suspensions, and viscous materials. Built with transparent borosilicate glass and advanced PID temperature control, this unit is ideal for research labs, universities, food technology, pharmaceuticals, and plant extract processing.Spray dryers are widely used in extracts and mycology because they transform liquid extracts, broths, or suspensions into stable, free-flowing powders in a fast and controlled process. While spray drying does involve heat, the exposure time is extremely short—often just a few seconds, which helps minimise thermal degradation compared to conventional drying methods. This makes it suitable for many, though not all, heat-sensitive compounds. In mycology, spray drying is valuable for producing mushroom extract powders, enzyme preparations, fermentation broths, and mycelial biomass with consistent particle size and improved solubility. Beyond mycology, spray dryers are commonly used in pharmaceuticals, food and beverage production, nutraceuticals, flavours and fragrances, dairy processing, herbal extracts, and chemical manufacturing, where they help create stable powders with long shelf life, easy dosing, and excellent flow properties.Key Features-High Efficiency NozzleRefined design ensures excellent atomizationand consistent powder quality.–Colour LCD Touch ScreenIntuitive interface with full automation.Switch to manual mode anytime during operation for easy adjustment of process parameters.–Automatic Nozzle CleaningBuilt-in through-needle cleaning system.Automatically clears blockages.Adjustable needle-passing frequency—ideal for viscous materials.–Safety & ProtectionShutdown protection prevents overheating or heater damage if the fan is turned off incorrectly.–Premium ConstructionSpray, drying, and collection components are made from high-quality, heat-resistant borosilicate glass.Two-fluid stainless steel atomization system with compact, auxiliary-free design.–Built-In Oil-Free Air CompressorProduces uniform particle distribution.and more:Excellent powder fluidity.Ultra-low noise (below 60 dB).Advanced PID Temperature ControlReal-time feedback for precise temperature stability.Heating temperature accuracy: ±1°C.Uniform Powder OutputOver 95% of dry powder falls within the same particle size range.Technical SpecificationsAir Inlet Temperature 30–300°CAir Outlet Temperature 30–150°CElectric Heater Power 3 kW (AC 220V)Evaporation Capacity 2000 ml/hMaximum Feed Rate 2000 ml/hFan Power 0.55 kWMaximum Air Volume 5.6 m³/minMaximum Air Pressure 1020 PaAir Compressor Power 0.2 kWNozzle Diameter 1.00 mmOperating Temperature 10–40°CDimensions 800 × 650 × 1300 mmWeight 125 kgPlease note we cannot accept cancellations for this product if they were ordered on backorder.",

Welcome to this astonishing world.Fungi can appear anywhere, from desert dunes to frozen tundra. They can invade our bodies and live between our toes or our floorboards.  They are unwelcome intruders or vastly expensive treats and symbols of both death and eternal life. But despite their familiar presence, there’s still much to learn about the eruption, growth, and decay of their secret, interconnected world.Aliya Whiteley has always loved fungi—from her childhood taking blurry photographs of strange fungal eruptions on Exmoor to a career as a writer inspired by their surreal and alien beauty. This love for fungi is a love for life, from single-cell spores to the largest living organism on the planet, a story stretching from Aliya’s lawn into orbit and back again via every continent.From fields, feasts and fairy rings to death caps, puffballs and ambrosia beetles, this is an intoxicating journey into the life of an extraordinary organism, one that we have barely begun to understand.Check out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World.",

It provides the essential carbon and energy supply required by explants and cultured tissues, supporting callus growth, root and shoot formation, and overall vigorous development.This sucrose dissolves quickly and offers excellent batch-to-batch consistency, making it suitable for all standard media formulations, including MS, B5, and custom blends.In plant tissue culture, S011 Sucrose ACS Grade serves as the primary carbon source because cultured tissues typically lack sufficient photosynthetic ability. It fuels respiration, growth, and cell division, enabling the synthesis of vital biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.Beyond nutrition, sucrose also plays a key role in regulating osmotic pressure within the medium. Proper osmotic balance protects cells from plasmolysis or lysis, stabilises cell membranes, and supports efficient nutrient and water uptake. Adjusting sucrose concentrations can influence morphogenesis, trigger root or shoot formation, and even induce somatic embryogenesis—an important process for clonal propagation, genetic transformation, and conservation work.Disclaimer: Results may vary depending on species, protocols, and experimental conditions. Consult relevant literature or tissue-culture specialists to optimise usage for your specific application.Key FeaturesHigh-purity ACS-grade sucrose optimised for plant tissue cultureSupports healthy growth, callus formation, and morphogenesisLow impurity profile for reduced contamination riskFast-dissolving; ideal for both liquid and solid mediaSuitable for micropropagation, callus culture, rooting, and general in-vitro workRecommended Usage20–30 g per litre of prepared medium (species- and protocol-dependent)Available Sizes100 g • 500 g • 1 kgBulk and regular supply options available—contact us to discuss recurring orders.",

    "description": "DescriptionThis is a book by David Moore for the general reader about the world of fungi. We should know more about fungi. They have killed, saved, and served us since before written records began. We have been making bread, brewing ale, and fermenting wine for millennia. Our crops have been at the mercy of fungal diseases since we became farmers, and they still are. Fungal diseases have caused large demographic changes – from the great plague of ‘St. Anthony’s Fire’ of the Middle Ages (caused by a fungal toxin) to the Irish mass migration to the Americas during the famine (caused by a fungal disease of the potato crop).We can also thank fungi for antibiotics, but do we fully appreciate the revolution in lifestyle (and life expectancy) that these taken-for-granted treatments permit? One of the first people to receive penicillin treatment in England in the 1940s was a policeman in Oxford. He died of septicemia when the supplies of the antibiotic ran out after he had been scratched by a rose thorn.Fungi enabled plants (by a mutualistic combination that persists today) to invade the land during the evolution of life on Earth. Higher fungi are almost unique in their ability to decay the chemical components of timber. Without the wood-rotting fungi, we would be up to our eyes in dead trees.Fungi give us the opportunity to treat plant diseases and kill specific weeds, as well as being very useful for cleaning up polluted environments and for producing chemicals. In short, this book will show you why it is wise to look again at fungi and appreciate these extraordinary organisms for what they are: a vital component of our lives and of the Earth’s ecosystem.Check out ourMycology Booksto learn more about this Fantastic Fungi World.",

Most mycelium requires a neutral pH to thrive.Key Benefits of our Coco Coir Block:Clean and Contamination-Free: Our coco coir is free of added fertilisers and salts that can stall mycelium growth. It is also free of Trichoderma, a common contaminant in horticultural-grade coco coir that can compete with mycelium and hinder mushroom growth.Superior Water Retention: Coco coir can hold up to 9 times its weight in water, providing a consistently moist environment essential for the growth and development of mushroom mycelium.Compatible with Vermiculite and Gypsum: When used with vermiculite and gypsum, our coco coir creates an ideal substrate for mushrooms with low nutrition requirements. Following our guidelines and recipes, you can achieve optimal substrate conditions for your mushroom cultivation.Environmentally Friendly: Our coco coir is 100% renewable and environmentally friendly. Once you have used it for mushroom cultivation, you can discard it in your garden.To help you achieve optimal results, we have provided a recipe for preparing 2 kg of the final substrate or 4 litres (wet) at field capacity using our coco coir. Follow these steps to prepare the substrate. Youmustfollow the steps as laid out:Cut a portion of the coco coir block and weigh out 225 g. Also, prepare 125 g ofVermiculite,28 g ofGypsum, and 10g ofCalcium Hydroxide.Add 1.8 L of boiling water and 10 g of calcium hydroxide to a plastic container (no metal) and mix well.Add 225 g of coco coir to the mixture, vermiculite 125 g, and gypsum 28 g.Once the mix has absorbed the water and cooled down, mix it to distribute the contents evenly, add the mushroom spawn, and fruit it in your desired method.Adjust the ratio to get your desired final weight of the substrate. For example, if you need 5 kg, double the quantity in the ratio. If you need help calculating the ratio, you can contact us.It’s worth noting that the coco coir used in the US differs from the one used in Australia. Unlike the Australian coco coir, which is highly compressed and comes in a 1:4 ratio, the US coco coir is usually not compacted. As a result, the ratio for preparing the final substrate at field capacity can be quite different.Unlock the full potential of your mushroom cultivation with our 5 kg Coco Coir Block. This sustainable, high-performance growing medium supports healthy, vibrant mycelial growth for a successful and bountiful mushroom harvest. Our customer support team is readily available to assist you with any questions or concerns that you may have about our coco coir or mushroom cultivation in general. We strive to offer expert guidance and practical advice, helping you achieve the best possible results from your cultivation endeavours.We also sell sterilised substrates, including Coco +Vermiculite+Gypsum, in our store.",

Unicorn PP bags was tested at the highest levels of 121 C for 3.5 hours.  No PE bags or other manufacturers’ PP bags have achieved this important food safety criteria. So rest assured you are not getting any microplastics from our kits.Bags are assured 100% contaminant-free due to their sterilization process of 3 hours at 20 psi in a commercial autoclave. Under certain circumstances, contamination can still occur, which could have occurred while the product was being shipped. In the unlikely event that you see contamination in your bag that may be due to shipping, please send us a photo within 2 weeks of receiving the item for a full refund or replacement. Your bags are made to order; please allow 2 to 3 days of handling time. We recommend that the bags be used as soon as possible to minimize the chances of contamination.KEY ITEM FEATURESFruit Straight from the bag!Your kit includes:50% Millet grains (Sterile and prepared at field capacity)50% Substrate (40% Hardwood Pellets, 10% wood chips & 50% Soy Hulls)Instructions sheet provided with every order1x Self-healing injection portAlcohol swabBag Size: 10.16cmX 7.62cmX 45.72cmFilter Size: 3.81cmX 3.81cmBrand of the bag- Unicorn (4-T)In case 4-T bags are out of stock, we shall use10-T bags instead. 10-T Size-12.7cmX 10.16cmX 45.72cm (Both have Inj ports).There is no need for grain-to-substrate transfer, which often leads to contamination. It essentially removes one of the most contamination-prone steps out of the mushroom growing process, saving a lot of hassle.StepsThe lower part of the bag consists of grains. Sanitize the injection port, Flame the needle until red, let it cool, and then inject the grains through the injection port with 10cc Liquid culture or a completely sterile spore syringe.Once inoculated, move the bag around without shaking. This helps the liquid to move around the bag and not settle at the bottom.Keep the bag in a dry and dark spot at around 24°c on average.Check the bag in one week or two when all the grains are colonized.Simply take the bag and shake it to mix the substrate and grains together. Be careful not to strain the top of the bag, which has been heat-sealed.Keep the bag again for a week in a dry and dark spot at 24°c.Ready to fruit as per your mushroom species- Some are top fruiting, and others are side fruiting.The recommended time frame for use once received is a maximum of 2 weeks.FRUITING INSTRUCTIONS– To fruit from the side, just cut an x in the bag when fully colonized (See pictures)– To fruit from the top, just cut the top part of the bag where the seal is. Please leave some space on top to create a reservoir of C02. (See pictures)Once fully colonized, these bags can also be removed from the mushroom bag and kept in afruiting chamber.

    "description": "DescriptionCalcium Hydroxide Lime/ Hydrated Lime (Ca(OH)2) for substrate cold pasteurization technique mushroom growingThis product is Naturally High in Calcium and low in Magnesium. It is also called Calcium Hydroxide, Slaked Lime, and Builder’s Lime. Its chemical formula is Ca(OH)2. This hydrated Lime is perfect for cold water pasteurization for your substrate. That is because the Lime will change the PH of the medium drastically, leading to all contaminants dying.Pasteurization only kills living organisms, not their spores, so we recommend using boiling water instead of cold water with this technique. This method is called super pasteurization.With pasteurization, you dispose of a 2-week window before it is prone to contamination. Ensuring complete substrate colonization within 2 weeks will provide a robust defense mechanism for the mycelium before contaminants start to sporulate. For instance, we recommend a higher grain-to-substrate ratio with this technique. Typically, you would only be required to add 5-10% spawn to your substrate. However, we recommend a 20-25% minimum spawn ratio when using pasteurization.The key feature of this product is that it removes the autoclave/pressure cooker process when growing mushrooms. Moreover, it will add much-needed calcium to the mycelium, enhancing the speed of growth and vigor.It is best to use a low nutritional substrate when using this method. It includes sugarcane mulch, straw, coco coir, vermiculite, etc.Your purchase includes:50gm , 300gm or 1Kg of Hydrated Lime (Ca(OH)2)Specifications:Chemical Name: Calcium DihydroxideChemical Formula: Ca(OH)2Colour: WhiteAppearance: PowderOdour: OdourlesspH: 12.4 (saturated solution at 20˚C)Purity: 95%Solubility: Soluble in waterOther Names: Hydrated Lime, Slaked Lime, Pickling LimeInstructionsImportant:Use proper protective equipment such as a mask, gloves, and eye protection.Soak your substrate for 3-12 hours in cold water/ hot water treated with Hydrated Lime.Drain water and inoculate with your mushroom grain spawn.Ratios:Using the amount of water specified is recommended so you do not have to drain any excess water.For every 1 Kg of straw, you may need 4 Liters of water.For every liter of water, you would need 5 gms of Lime.Grain Spawn: We recommend inoculating with at least 25% grain spawn (1 partGrain spawn: 4 parts substrate). As a result, it will shorten colonization, reducing the chances for other contaminants to grow and thrive.If you intend to measure the PH levels on your substrate after adding Lime, we offerPH stripsin our store.Get everything you need toGrow Mushrooms in MonotubsandGrow Mushroom in Bucketsin Our Store",

If you have a magnetic stirrer, this will mix the solution properly. The content needs to be poured slowly and not all at once.Autoclave or pressure cook for 20-45 minutes at 15 psi.After taking it out of autoclave, ensure the agar and mix does not settle at the bottom, we use a magnetic stirrer machine, to continuously stir the mix while its cooling. We use a infrared thermometer to check the temperature of the agar . If you use a magnetic stirrer machine, ensure you have added a magnetic stirrer bar into the regent bottle before sterilisation.Pour into Petri dishes when it reaches 50 degrees Celsius (Approximately hot enough to hold the flask/ jar with one hand). Agar will start to solidiy around 45. So this gives you a window of about 20-25 minute to pour your plates.Once the Petri dishes are set, inoculate them and wrap them with parafilm. Keeping the plates aside for a week is recommended to check for contamination.IF its your first try.Petri dishes are best to be stored upside down to avoid condensation.Petri dishes are poured in a still air box or in front of laminar flowhood.Why use MEAG instead of just MEA?Spores obtained from wild, homegrown, or trustable spore sellers Might include bacterial contamination. That is due to methods of spore collection, preservation, and transportation (Such as spore syringes and spore prints). In several cases, when spores are infected, they carry bacteria attached to them and introduce them to the Agar media. This will result in fast-growing bacterial spores that make it difficult for mushroom spores to germinate (as they are slower than bacterial spores).On the other hand, when infected spores are introduced to MEAG, the mushroom spores will germinate and grow, leaving behind bacterial contamination. That is because the cells composing the mycelium (Hyphae) have long and sharp filaments, which carry reduced populations (if any) of bacteria when they pass through the MEAG.Checkout ourPre-Poured Agar Platescategory if you are not wanting to make your own plates.Do not have apressure cooker? You can alsoMicrowave Sterilize, its a learning curve to use microwave but becomes easier with practice. Tip-you would need a smaller reagent bottle like 500ml so that it can fit your microwave.

However, increased fresh air exchange promotes the development of their characteristic conk-shaped fruiting bodies.True Reishi, scientifically known as Ganoderma lucidum, is not permitted for import or sale in Australia. However, there is a native variety of Ganoderma found in Queensland, which is also considered medicinal and is the closest alternative to true Reishi. This local Ganoderma can be grown as either conks or antlers, depending on the environmental conditions. Higher CO2 levels encourage antler growth, while increased fresh air exchange leads to the formation of conks. Antlers do not produce spores, but if they are grown in a high CO2 environment and later exposed to more air, conks will form on top of the antlers and begin to release spores. Reishi mushrooms are prolific spore producers, so it’s recommended to fruit them inside bags in a high CO2 environment. Although conks are often associated with medicinal benefits, antlers also possess the same therapeutic properties.

    "description": "DescriptionMagnetic Stirrer in Mycelium CultivationA magnetic stirrer is an essential tool in mycology, especially in the making of liquid culture. Its utility is paramount in two main stages:Mycelium Breakdown:Purpose: Just as a mixer grinder pulverizes food, a magnetic stirrer disintegrates mycelium clumps, enabling them to grow independently. This step is particularly crucial post-inoculation, especially when using agar.Benefit: By fragmenting the mycelium into smaller particles, they can grow individually and colonize the substrate more rapidly. This results in a more uniform and swift colonization of the medium. It’s best to use the stirrer at 90% speed during this phase.Aeration During Colonisation:Purpose: Once the desired colonization level is reached, the stirrer’s role transitions from mycelium breakdown to mere agitation of the mixture.Benefit: Gentle and gradual stirring aids in incorporating air, which is essential for mycelium growth and metabolic functions. Proper aeration ensures the mycelium receives the oxygen it necessitates. At this stage, utilize the stirrer at 30-40% speed.Your Purchase Includes:1 x Magnetic Stirrer1 x Stir Bar1 x Power Adapter (AU Plug)1 x User Manual (English)Optional Add-On: 5 stirrer bars, 7*30mm Type-CFeatures:Adjustable Speed: 0~3500r/min; Max.

Check these listings in our storeFor Liquid Culture:We’ve tested various stirrers for agitating liquid culture and have found Ciblanc to be the superior choice. It agitates the magnet inside a mason jar at high speed without causing the magnet bar to drift to the sides. This ensures the mycelium is broken up optimally, accelerating colonization. This product is outstanding for expanding mycelium cultures.If you find the bar constantly spinning off, increase the speed incrementally rather than jumping to full speed. Ensure the bar is centered in the jar and the jar is placed in the middle of the machine before starting. The speed requirement might vary based on the volume of the liquid in the jar.We also offer additional magnetic stirrer bars in our store.This product is currently being rebranded, so you may receive an H2O-branded stirrer instead of Ciblanc. The product itself remains exactly the same — only the branding has changed.Warranty: 2 yearsShould you encounter any issues with this product, please reach out to the manufacturer within 2 years of your purchase.

    "description": "DescriptionWhite French Millet birdseedThis Product cannot be shipped to WAOur millet is sourced from reputable Australian suppliers (Avigrain). Australian grown.Safe for human consumption.The grains will come in 3 different variations:5Kg, 10 Kg or 20 KgSometimes Avigrain sent us a 20kg bag in plain white packaging instead of a green branded one.Please read below if you want to use these millets, particularly for mycology!Why Choose Millets?Nutritional Benefits Size: Millets are renowned for their nutritional benefits and are perfectly sized for cultivation. They are considerably smaller than other grains such as Wheat, Rye, Oats, or Corn. This size advantage ensures that they blend more uniformly with the substrate and provide a higher number of inoculation points, leading to a reduced contamination rate from faster, more even colonization.Easy Cleaning Popularity: Cleaning millets is a breeze. They’re also gaining traction in the mycology community, with more resources available about their utilization.Purity: Millets stand out because they are clean with no pesticides added for preservation. Unlike Rye and Wheat, they don’t have dust.You can also buypre-sterilized milletin 500 g, 1 Kg, and 2 Kg variants.Preparation of Millet Grains for Mushroom Cultivation:Soaking: Directly soak the grains without washing them in a bucket for 12 – 24 hours, ensuring they are completely submerged. This step is crucial for mycelium growth. TheDensity of Hydrated Milletis 0.95 kg/L or 950 kg/m³Draining: Drain the water with a fine mesh or similar straining tool. Ensure that the mesh’s pores are small enough to retain the millets. Now wash the grains with plenty of fresh water using a hose or under a running tap.Additives: Incorporate gypsum and calcium carbonate. Gypsum ensures the grains remain separate, while calcium carbonate adjusts the grain’s pH, potentially enhancing yields. We suggest adding 5% of the total weight after soaking. Thoroughly mix after addition.Sterilization: Transfer the millets into mason jars equipped with an air filter and injection port. Then, place them in a sterilizer. Mushroom bags are also suitable. A sterilization duration of 2 hours and 30 minutes is optimal. Ensure the containers are filled to no more than 60% capacity to facilitate proper gas exchange during subsequent mycelium colonization.Inoculation: Once sterilization is complete and the containers have cooled, introduce your selected culture. Proper adherence to procedures is essential to minimize contamination risks. Use any inoculation media such as liquid culture, grain spawn, or agar plates.Labeling: Post-inoculation, clearly label each bag with the inoculation date and the specific culture used.Understanding Ratios:Following the procedure above, the water retention rate for our millet is approximately 40%. Thus, the millet’s final weight after preparation will be 40% more than its dry weight. To compute the wet weight, multiply the dry weight by 1.4.For clarity: Soaking and cooking 5kg of Millet results in about 7kgs. To derive any other desired final weight, use this formula:Illustrative Example: If you aim for 10 bags of 1 kg millet each:Calculate:10/1.4 = 7.15 kg.This means you need to soak 7.15 kg of dry millet for 12-24 hours to yield 10 kg of wet millet, suitable for producing 10 bags of 1 kg each.",

Buy 5 of each type of pre-poured agar plate rather than buy each type separately.A bubble or condensation on any of the plates is not a cause for concern and does not affect the product’s quality.MEAG is made with antibacterial powder, so it will not grow bacteria. It’s the most common contamination in spores.MEA is without anti-bacterial agents, so it will grow anything you put in it, so it’s best to check if your culture is contaminated or not. It is useful if you want to store your culture, isolate your culture, test the reliability of culture from a vendor, or even test the liquid culture you have made yourself.Please be advised that during the months of December through February, shipping agar plates can be particularly challenging due to environmental factors. When the temperature of the package exceeds 40°C, the plastic wrap or wax parafilm used for sealing may melt, shrink, or otherwise be compromised due to heat. This can increase the likelihood of contamination.If you encounter contamination, please send us a clear photo of the affected plates, along with the number of plates affected and your order number. A refund will be issued upon verification of the issue.Please note that we are unable to offer replacements, as the same environmental conditions may lead to similar issues. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this period.Plate Shelf Life and StorageThe optimal shelf life for plates is 30-45 days. Order plates as needed, as they cannot be stored indefinitely, even in their original packaging. While most plates can last for months, their ideal shelf life is 30 days.Usage and ContaminationPlates may remain usable beyond 30 days if uncontaminated. If contamination occurs in one plate, it doesn’t affect others in the pack. Discard contaminated plates and use the rest as normal.The presence of a bubble or condensation in any of the plates is not a cause for concern.Long-term StorageExtended storage may cause plates to lose moisture, becoming stiff and papery. Use plates only if they remain gelatinous and uncontaminated. Discard any that become stiff or papery, as they can no longer support organism growth.Refund PolicyFor damaged or contaminated plates upon delivery:•⁠ ⁠Contact us within 30 days of the ORDER date•⁠ ⁠Provide photos for refund requests•⁠ ⁠No replacements are offered; only refundsStorage GuidelinesBefore inoculation:•⁠ ⁠Store in a cool, dry place (e.g., cupboard)•⁠ ⁠Avoid refrigeration to prevent condensation•⁠ ⁠Place upside down to minimize condensationPlease note condensation in the plate is normal and would arise from temperature differential.After colonization:•⁠ ⁠Refrigerate when at least 60% colonized•⁠ ⁠Label (date and species) and put in zip-lock bags for storage•⁠ ⁠It is best to keep it in the vegetable compartment of the fridgeRemember: The packaging sleeve is not a sterile seal.

Designed specifically for Wood-loving mushrooms, this substrate is hydrated to field capacity, ensuring optimal moisture content for mushroom growth.This substrate is made from 80% sawdust (from hardwood) and 20% bran. Sawdust is the primary component, supplemented by bran, which provides quick growth because of extra nitrogen. For species like Shiitake and Turkey Tail, a nutrition ratio higher than 20% is not recommended as they primarily thrive on wood and don’t respond well to excess nutrition. Thus, this Sawdust and Bran Mushroom Substrate is an excellent substrate for them. Any medicinal mushrooms are best grown slowly as they pack more medicinal benefits than a mushroom that has grown relatively quickly. (This statement may not be accurate for all medicinal mushrooms).This substrate can be used for all wood-loving species. Go toGrain Spawnand click on the “Fruiting Temperature tab” for more information.If you are working with our Grain spawn and do not want to use up all the spawn in one go,  inoculated a grain bag with agar or inoculated a substrate bag with grain spawn for which you had to cut open the bag but have no way to seal the bag again consider to have ourLargeSealing Bag ClipsWe use organic Wheat bran and Hardwood Sawdust along with Hardwood chips.

It is easy to stock and grip and has an anti-slip ring that offers stability.Malt Extract Yeast Agar Peptone (MYPA)What is MYPA?MYPA Mix is the most nutritious gelatinous media to cultivate, isolate, and manipulate fungi. That is due to Peptone, which is derivative from soybeans and beef bone that supports vigorous mycelium growth and demonstrates the most efficient media for long-term maintenance of mushroom cultures (more than a year). The uses of MYPA include:Growing mushroom mycelium for expansion into grain spawnLong-term storage of your isolated strain of MyceliumPlease note this mix has yeast and Peptone and is extremely nutritious. Hence, this medium will have a higher likelihood of contamination if sterile procedures are not maintained. Still, it also means that mycelium has abundant nutrition to survive for long-term growth.These plates are treated with UVC light, greatly reducing contamination chances.Why use Malt Extract Agar Yeast Peptone for growing mushroom culture?Malt ExtractMalt extract contains a high concentration of maltose, which provides a suitable environment for the growth of yeast and mold. That is due to its rich source of carbon, protein, and nitrogenous compounds, which are used as energy for fungi growth.Agar-AgarAgar-Agar is extracted from various seaweeds, such as gracilaria and gelidium (It contains no animal ingredients. Due to Agar’s unique gel property and stability, it is used as a firming and thickening agent for Petri dish experimentation.)Yeast (S. Cerevisiae)The strain species S. Cerevisiae is grown on sugar beet molasses, making it a natural source of readily assimilated amino acids and proteins. For mushrooms, this means a rich supplemented diet of dietary fiber, Vitamin D, and B Complex (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12).PeptoneMycological peptone is a mixture of peptones derived from soybean plants and animals. It is commonly used in liquid culture recipes and agar recipes and also added to substrate as a supplement.Supplementation with Peptone not only stimulates the growth of mycelium but also greatly improves the quality of the projected Mycelium Mat.We also offer a variety of otherPre-Poured Agar PlatesandAgar Mixesto make your own agar plates.

For example, the volume of your mold 30cm x 28cm x 3cm is 2.52 litres.Our sawdust 3 KG  and hemp hurd 3KG are roughly 5 Liters in volume.Upon Arrival:After receiving it, you might need to store the product for an additional 2-3 days. Begin usage when you notice white mycelium growth.There’s no need to wait for complete coverage; when 10-20% of the bag turns white, it’s ready for the next step.Storage upon arrivalPlace the bag in an open space, ensuring it stands upright and remains fully unfolded (the white part in the bag is the air filter, which allows the mycelium to breathe).Avoid exposure to direct airflow from fans, air conditioning, or heaters, and prevent direct sunlight. It’s best not to store inside cupboards or boxes.Check our listingCreate with Myceliumto get started with your projectsUsage Instructions:Once you observe fluffy mycelium growth, break up the ingredients inside the bag.Open the bag and start transferring the mixture into your mold:For larger molds, avoid packing the mixture too tightly.For smaller objects, you can compact the mixture slightly.Important Notes:Mycelium begins to harden from day 10 post-manufacturing, which can make it challenging to work with. We advise using the substrate before this hardening occurs.Order only when you’re set to start your project. Upon readiness, use the entire substrate promptly or within a few days.To decelerate the mycelium’s growth rate, you can refrigerate the medium.If not utilizing the entire substrate immediately, reseal the bag and refrigerate. Before reuse, bring the mycelium back to room temperature.Product Benefits:We supply sterile hemp hurd or Sawdust at field capacity (hydrated), fortified with nutrients, to guarantee rapid colonization.Please note that Hemp hurd colonizes fast, but sawdust is better for intricate and smaller molds. We find the sawdust medium pretty resilient when demolding and is not as brittle as the hemp hurd from the edges.",

    "description": "DescriptionYour purchase includes:3 sterilised, ready-to-use bags filled with 1 kg of brown rice flour and vermiculite. Each bag features a self-healing injection port for easy use.alcohol wipes to clean injection portThese Organic Brown Rice Flour (BRF) & Vermiculite bags are thoughtfully designed to offer the ideal environment for mycelium colonisation. While they may not yield a heavy flush of mushrooms, they are optimised for rapid colonisation and fruiting. They are fruited once its fully colonised and then taken out of tehir bag somewhere humid.Procedure for Use:Once your bag is fully colonised, remove it from the mushroom grow bag.Introduce it to a fruiting chamber. There are plenty of DIY tutorials on how to create your own fruiting chamber on YouTube , you can also use our inflatable monotub.One simple method involves setting up a fruiting chamber filled with Perlite (available at Bunnings). Just add some water and place the colonized bags on top of a piece of cardboard wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid contact with the Perlite. Ensure not to add too much water; the aim is to maintain humidity inside the fruiting chamber.Inoculation Process:In a clean environment, wipe the injection port with an alcohol wipe or spray it with isopropyl alcohol.Shake the LC syringe, sterilize the needle with a flame, then let it cool for a few seconds.Inject about 5ml of liquid culture or spore solution into the Brown Rice Flour + Vermiculite Bag.Fruiting Process:Once the mycelium block is fully colonized, cut open the bag and place the contents in the fruiting chamber. Depending on the variety, mushrooms should begin to appear within 7-8 days.After your first harvest, rehydrate your mycelium block by submerging it in sterile water in the fridge overnight (use boiled water that has cooled down). It will then be ready for a second flush.These bags are not suitable to be used for growing mushroom in a monotub with more substrate. BRF bags is a traditional way of growing mushroom for someone who does not want to research and want a quick grow sacrificing 80% yield. I fyou want a better way of growing look at teh video on our Inflatable monotub listing and start with a all in one bag or a grain bag.It’s essential to maintain sterile techniques, especially during the second or third flush, as the risk of contamination increases.We recommend using the bags as soon as possible to minimise the chance of contamination. Only order these bags when you have the liquid culture or spore syringe in hand.With our kit, you can enjoy growing your own mushrooms in less than a month.

    "description": "DescriptionThis Calcium Carbonate is made from limestone.In mushroom cultivation, it serves as a PH buffer for the substrate. This means that the PH will remain steady as the mushroom grows. Mycelium releases acid compounds to help digest the substrate media when it expands. These acids could drastically change the PH of the substrate, making it difficult for mushrooms to fruit. Calcium carbonate prevents the substrate from becoming too acidic for the mycelium to produce fruits. Depending on the method, soak, boil, and dry your grains and add Calcium Carbonate. Mix well and then sterilize.Use 5% of calcium carbonate for the total weight of your grain spawn.Note: Calcium Carbonate is NOT for pasteurizing.

    "description": "DescriptionThis Liquid Culture Kit is designed to help you take your first step into Mycology: working with liquid culture.With this kit, you can create liquid culture from a clone on an agar plate, a spore on an agar plate, or expand an existing liquid culture syringe.Kit Contents:2 x 473 ml Ball or Kerrwide-mouth jars2 xWide mouth Mycology lids with injection port and air filter2 xMagnetic stirrer bars1 xMagnetic stirrer machine with AU plug100 gSupercharge Liquid culture mix(use 10 grams per 500 ml of water)-Our mix is the best kind of simple, complex sugar and Soy peptone for supercharged growth. It’s the best recipe you can find.Instructions:Fill each jar with 250 ml of water (leaving extra headspace for air exchange).The white filter patch in the lid allows gas exchange. The black port is the injection port where you will draw the liquid once the culture is ready. Always spray the injection port with70% isopropyl alcoholand leave for 30 seconds before injecting.Add 5 g of liquid culture mix to each jar, fill with 250 ml of boiling water, and stir. It’s normal for the liquid to be hazy and have sediments. Don’t forget to add a magnetic stirrer bar.(When the mycelium starts growing in the liquid, it will clear up the sediment)Secure the lid, ensuring no leaks (tilt the jar to test for leakage), and cover it with aluminium foil to prevent the air filter from getting wet during sterilization.Sterilize for 30-45 minutes at 15 psi. After sterilization, let the jars cool down in front of a flow hood or inside the sterilizer. You can alsoMicrowave Sterilizethese jarsOnce cooled, check the injection port and air filter again for a secure fit as they may have become a bit loose after sterilization. It’s recommended to wait 1-2 weeks before inoculating to ensure sterility. You will notice a very cloudy growth which is a tell-tale sign for contamination. We have plenty of jars sitting on shelves ready to be used whenever we want, this way, we can get rid of the faulty jars before they have a chance to be inoculated, saving us time.In a still air box or in front of a flow hood, slightly loosen the jar lid. Sterilize your scalpel and transfer a piece of agar to the jar. Alternatively, use liquid culture by injecting through a sanitized injection port.Let the jars colonize at 22-25°C, in darkness if possible, to speed up the process. Stir occasionally for faster growth.When the mycelium is ready and appears jelly-like, the liquid culture is done.Before use, test the liquid culture onMEA platesorMEA containers. This ensures it is free of contamination.Once confirmed, label the jars and use them within a month at room temperature or 2-6 months if refrigerated at 4°C. Stir weekly to maintain oxygen levels.Tip- Do not forget to buy isopropyl alcohol(Not available in our Global store), Syringe and needle set and MEA Agar plates for testing. All of which can be found in thisLC shopping list.The Magnetic Stirrer Machine is currently being rebranded, so you may receive an H2O-branded stirrer Machine instead of Ciblanc. The product itself remains exactly the same — only the branding has changed.Enjoymaking your own liquid culture!",

This allows us sufficient time for handling and shipping. To minimise the risk of delays, please select the express shipping option with Auspost.Alternatively, we suggest considering our digital gift cards, allowing the recipient to choose the kits they love from our store.Lead time (mentioned in the listing above “add to cart” button) means time it takes to prepare this order. Product in stock does not mean its ready to send out, it means it can be prepared in the lead time mentioned.Every kit is different, so please read below:This kit uses a special Master’s Mix—a blend of sawdust, soy pellets, and water. It’s inoculated with about 300 grams of organic rye or millet grain spawn to give your mushrooms the best start.We keep things simple and affordable by sending you a fresh, made-to-order bag, just like real mushroom farms use. No fancy boxes, no sitting in cold storage for weeks. This helps keep your cost down by $10; we pass that saving directly to you. We call these kits ‘almost ready to fruit’.IMPORTANT- Check the fruiting temperature when you buy a kit and ensure you can provide it with the temperature it needs.What to Do When You Receive Your Bag:Step 1 – Let It Grow (10 days to 3 Weeks)Take thebag outof its packaging.Stand it upright so the white filter patch is unrestricted, this is where the mycelium in the bag breathes from. Do not cut the bag for fruiting yet.Please keep it away from direct sunlight, windows, fans, AC, or a wardrobe.Let it sit like this for 10 days to3 whole weeksfrom the inoculation date on the label.💡Tip for First-Timers:Don’t worry if the block doesn’t turn completely white! Lion’s mane mycelium is often light or barely visible, but it is still growing fine. You will know your kit is ready to fruit when you will already see tiny lions mane fruiting all over the bag. We here at LalaLab fruit them around 10 days mark from the date on the label, but the timing depends on the temperature and how fast they grow.Need to Wait?If you’re not ready to start fruiting you can store the bag in thefridge for up to a month. It will still continue to grow in fridge very slwoly, buying you some more time before you need to fruit it.Step 2 – Time to FruitAfter you see tiny balls of mushroom forming , it’s time to move on to the fun part—fruiting!Follow these three simple steps (summarised from above):Cut:Lay the bag on its side and make a 10–12 cm cut (an “X” or line) where the block touches the plastic. Gently push out the air and tuck the loose plastic underneath.Mist:Place the kit somewhere humid (kitchen or laundry is excellent as long as ther eis no direct sunlight ). Mist the cut area with water2–3 times a day. Frequent misting is better than heavy misting.Harvest:Mushrooms usually appear within 5–7 days and can be harvested within 1–3 weeks. Twist and pull them gently at the base.More Than One Harvest?Yes! You can getmultiple flushes. After harvesting, let the block rest for a week, keep misting, and wait for more mushrooms to grow.Common Mistake to Avoid: Delaying FruitingOne of the most common mistakes with Lion’s Mane mushroom kits is waiting too long to start fruiting. Unlike other mushrooms like oysters, which clearly show when they’re ready by turning entirely white inside the bag, Lion’s Mane mycelium can be trickier to read.Many people assume it’s still colonising, but it’s often ready earlier than expected. You may even notice small baby mushrooms (called “pins”) forming inside the bag. This means the mycelium is already spending energy trying to fruit, which isn’t ideal.The general 10-21 days guideline is just that—a guideline. Warmer temperatures can speed growth, while cooler temperatures can slow it down. It takes a bit of practice to get the timing just right. When growing them regularly, your aim is to time it and place it into fruiting before the tiny mushroom starts to form all over the bag, we need them to form outside teh bag in the area we cut for easy harvest.What to do if pins form inside the bag:Don’t worry. Just ignore the internal pins. Gently fold the top of the bag to push out excess air, hold in place with tape, cut a small “X” in the side of the bag (where you want the mushrooms to grow), and begin misting that spot daily. Mushrooms will start fruiting from that cut. The internal pins will eventually be aborted naturally, as they don’t have space to grow.Checkout out our fineMisting Spray Bottleto produce tiny droplets and keep humidity high. The size of droplets formed can easily be evoprated , this constant evoporation signals mycelium to pinOther Lion’s Mane Tips & TroubleshootingPink Mushrooms?If your Lion’s Mane starts growing with a pink hue, great job! That means conditions are ideal. The pink colour is normal and will fade to white as the mushroom matures.Yellowing Mushrooms?Yellow colouration usually means the humidity is too low or the temperature is too high. Increase misting or try moving the kit to a cooler spot.Mushrooms stopped growing?If growth stalls and your Lion’s Mane isn’t getting bigger, it likely means the conditions aren’t right. Most often, this is due to low humidity or incorrect temperature. Adjust your environment and give it another try.Want to Learn More?This kit introduces you toStage 3: Fruiting, the final step in mushroom growing.To explore all three stages (including how mushrooms grow from spores to harvest), check out ourEducational Mushroom Growing Kit.Could not fruit the bag, or was it contaminated?

Known asStropharia rugosoannulata, the Wine Cap is also called the Garden Giant or King Stropharia, famous for producing large, meaty mushrooms with a mild, nutty flavor.Why Choose Win Cap Sawdust SpawnSawdust spawn is ideal for outdoor cultivation because it colonises mulch, wood chips, and straw quickly and effectively. The 3kg size provides enough material to inoculate a generous garden bed, pathway, or permaculture area, is enough to cover a 1m2 area. Once established, Wine Caps can fruit for several seasons, giving you a consistent harvest year after year.Growing ConditionsWine Cap mushrooms thrive in shaded garden beds with hardwood chips, straw, or composted mulch. Simply spread the sawdust spawn evenly throughout the prepared substrate, water to maintain consistent moisture, and allow the mycelium to colonise. Fruiting temperatures range between 12°C and 25°C, and pinning is triggered by microbial activity in the bed.Benefits of Growing Wine Cap MushroomsProduces impressive, gourmet-quality mushroomsImproves soil health by breaking down organic matterNaturally suppresses weeds when grown in mulched bedsPairs well with vegetable gardens for a healthier ecosystemEasy to maintain and perfect for beginnersWhen to grow Wine cap?Except winter, establish the wine cap anytime. Best time are spring and autumn. Temperature in the shaded spot should not go above 34°C or below 10°C for atleast 3 months while the mycelium is being established.During the establishment phase, ensure proper moisture in the growing area.Taste and Culinary UsesWine Cap mushrooms have a firm texture and a flavor similar to roasted potatoes or sweet corn. They are excellent for grilling, stir-frying, adding to soups, or roasting.With our high-quality 3kg Wine Cap Sawdust Spawn, you can transform your garden into a productive mushroom bed and enjoy fresh, homegrown mushrooms straight from your backyard.These are spawn bags and not fruiting kits to fruit from the bag.Upon arrival, remove the bag from the box and unfold it to ensure the white filter patch is fully exposed, as this is where the mycelium breathes. Allow the bag to rest for 3–5 days in a location away from direct sunlight and airflow.Use our Sawdust spawn for outdoor garden beds, it provides up to 1000 times more inoculation points than grain spawn, promising even and swifter colonisation in the long run. Sawdust spawn is preferred over grain spawn for outdoor cultivation as birds and insects tend to eat the grain before they have time to colonise your garden.Did you know that we sell Mushroom culture in form ofLiquid culture,Log plug dowel spawn,Agar plate,Mushroom grain spawn,Sawdust Substrateand asMushroom Growing Kits?.",

    "description": "DescriptionOur 3 kg pre-sterilized, ready-to-use Master Mix Mushroom Substrate is ideal for mushroom cultivation. Designed specifically for Wood-loving mushrooms, this substrate is hydrated to field capacity, ensuring optimal moisture content for mushroom growth. It is ideal for all woodloving mushroom species that like wood.This substrate is a balanced blend of 50% hardwood sawdust and 50% soy pellets. Soy pellets are rich in fiber and nitrogen, essential for boosting mushroom growth. However, as the mixture contains only half wood, the later stages of mushroom growth might not be as prolific as the initial burst. This mix is excellent for various mushrooms but is not the best choice for species like Shiitake and Turkey Tail, which thrive in environments with more wood. The Master’s Mix is famous in mushroom farms and starter kits because it helps achieve a quick and impressive first harvest. It is incredibly motivating for beginners in mushroom cultivation and offers a faster turnaround for mushroom farmers.The Master’s Mix Mushroom Substrate also comes with Woodchips. When mycelium comes in contact with woodchips while growing, they become really Vigorous—resulting in thicker and faster colonization. For more information about Mycelium, check out OurGrain Spawn.If you are working with our Grain spawn and do not want to use up all the spawn in one go,  inoculated a grain bag with agar or inoculated a substrate bag with grain spawn for which you had to cut open the bag but have no way to seal the bag again consider to have ourLargeSealing Bag ClipsSource and Quality of Sawdust and Soy PelletsWe source our Sawdust directly from Tasmania, and pellets are made from Australian hardwood.

Let’s be honest; these bags are not meant to give you a heavy flush of mushrooms. These bags are designed to colonise fast and give you the mushroom at the fastest possible time.Each bag must be removed from the mushroom grow bag once they have completely colonized and must be introduced to the fruiting chamber. There are plenty of videos to make your own fruiting chamber on YouTube!This is the simplest way of growing your own mushrooms, as you do not need a grain transfer or substrate transfer. Grow directly out of the bag.One of the easiest methods is to create a mono-tub and fill it with Perlite (easily available in Bunnings). Add some water and put the colonized bags on top of cardboard wrapped with aluminum foil so that the mycelium block does not touch the perlite. Don’t add too much water, as the purpose of water is to maintain humidity inside the monotub. If you are in any trouble regarding this, we are happy to assist you.We recommend that the bags are used as soon as possible to minimize the chances of contamination.How to inoculate?In a clean environment, wipe the injection port with an alcohol swab or spray withisopropyl alcohol.Shake theLC syringeand Flame sterilize the needle.Cool the needle for a few seconds and inject around 5 ml of liquid culture into the Brown Rice Flour + Vermiculite Bag.Once ready to fruit, use the following method-1) Once the block of Mycelium is colonized, cut the bag open and place the bag’s contents in the fruiting chamber. Mushrooms will start growing in 7-8 days, depending on the variety.2) Once you have harvested your first batch, keep the block submerged in Sterile water in the fridge overnight (Boiled water which was cooled down). This will hydrate your mycelium block and is ready for the second flushDuring the second or third flush, the contamination rate is high if the sterile technique is not maintained.This bag can give you your own mushrooms in less than a month.In case you wish to make your own BRF bags, we also offerBrown Rice Flour in bulk.",

This product has proven long-lasting and highly durable; it is autoclavable and widely used for grain jars and liquid cultures.Self-healing Injection port:The self-healing Silicone Injection Port allows a needle to pass through while self-healing. It is autoclavable and long-lasting. Multiple times, we have sprayed alcohol on this product prior to inoculation, and it has shown no signs of deterioration. It is easy to clean and has a simple but elegant design, which homemade self-healing injection ports lack.3M PrimerWhat makes these items efficient and secure is the 3M strong adhesive. It can resist autoclave temperatures over 121 Celsius at 15psi for extended periods when kept covered and dry during sterilization (We have proved that it withstands higher psi. However, it is not recommended for lasting usability). We recommend keeping the jar covered with foil paper on top to avoid water/steam getting inside.Usability:Grain jars.Liquid Culture jars.PF TEK culturing.",

Also known as black forest mushroom. Top fruiting.Incubation T°: 23°C , duration:25 Days. Fruiting conditions: Temperature: 7-21 °C, relative humidity: 85-95 %, CO2-concentration: 600-1400 ppm, Light: 500-1000 luxShiitakes are grown on a mix of sawdust and bran, generally 80% sawdust and 20% bran or 90% sawdust and 10% bran. Do not grow on master’s mix, as it is highly likely to be contaminated.Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) have a unique cultivation process compared to many other mushroom species. While traditionally grown on logs, they can also be successfully cultivated on 3-4 kg substrate bags of sawdust.The mycelium colonization for shiitake is notably slow, taking around 6 weeks for complete colonization.During this process, the mycelium initially appears white but then undergoes a distinctive browning phase, which takes about two additional weeks.Once fully colonized, the plastic bag(mushroom bag) is removed, and the entire block is placed in a fruiting room with high humidity (80-90%) and temperatures between 7-21°C.After the first flush of mushrooms is harvested, allowing the block to rest for about two weeks before initiating the next fruiting cycle is crucial.This resting period is essential to prevent contamination.Other things to prevent contamination during the fruiting stage are to keep the temperature lower and maintain adequate airflow.This mushroom liquid culture is made with the best strain we can find. It is checked every six months for its vigour and ability to fruit on a commercial scale. Each jar is tested before it is sent out.

Best fruiting temp: 23°-25°CWhen Reishi mushrooms are grown in environments with high CO₂ levels, they form antler-like shapes. However, increased fresh air exchange promotes the development of their characteristic conk-shaped fruiting bodies.True Reishi, scientifically known as Ganoderma lucidum, is not permitted for import or sale in Australia. However, there is a native variety of Ganoderma found in Queensland, which is also considered medicinal and is the closest alternative to true Reishi. This local Ganoderma can be grown as either conks or antlers, depending on the environmental conditions. Higher CO2 levels encourage antler growth, while increased fresh air exchange leads to the formation of conks. Antlers do not produce spores, but if they are grown in a high CO2 environment and later exposed to more air, conks will form on top of the antlers and begin to release spores. Reishi mushrooms are prolific spore producers, so it’s recommended to fruit them inside bags in a high CO2 environment. Although conks are often associated with medicinal benefits, antlers also possess the same therapeutic properties. Reishi is known for its rapid colonization and is commonly used in the production of myco-materials.Check out all the variety ofGrain Spawnon offer.",

That is due to peptone derived from soybeans that supports vigorous mycelium growth and demonstrates the most efficient medium for long-term maintenance of mushroom cultures (more than a year). The uses of MYPA include:Growing mushroom mycelium for expansion into grain spawnLong term storageWhy use Malt Extract Agar Yeast for growing mushroom culture?Malt ExtractMalt extract contains a high concentration of maltose, which provides a suitable environment for the growth of yeast and mold. That is due to its rich source of carbon, protein, and nitrogenous compounds that are used as energy for fungi growth.Agar-AgarAgar-Agar is extracted from various seaweeds, such as gracilaria and gelidium (It contains no animal ingredients. Due to Agar’s unique gel property and stability, it is used as a firming and thickening agent for Petri dish experimentation.)Yeast (S. Cerevisiae)The strain species S. Cerevisiae is grown on sugar beet molasses, making it a natural source of readily assimilated amino acids and proteins. For mushrooms, this means a rich supplemented diet of dietary fiber, Vitamin D, and B Complex (Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Biotin, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12).PeptoneMycological Peptone is derived from Soybean plants, commonly used in Liquid culture recipes and agar recipes and also added to Substrate as a supplement.Supplementation with Peptone stimulates mycelium’s growth and dramatically improves the quality of the projected Mycelium Mat.*Not for human consumption*Quantity specifications:These quantities are measured based on 60*15mm size Petri dishes:The number of plates made will vary according to pouring techniques; we recommend using just enough to cover the surface of the petri dish.*Petri dish is not included.21 gm makes 35Agar Plates (Use 500ml of hot water)42 gm makes 70 Agar Plates (Use 1000ml of hot water)63 gm makes 105 Agar Plates (Use 1500ml of hot water)84 gm makes 140 Agar Plates (Use 2000ml of hot water)168gm makes 280 Agar Plates (Use 4000ml of hot water)InstructionsDissolve your MYPA packet in the specified ratio of hot water (i.e.1000, ml water for 42 gm of MYPA) and stir thoroughly with a spoon. If you have a magnetic stirrer, this will mix the solution properly. The content needs to be poured slowly and not all at once.Autoclave or pressure cook for 20 minutes at 15 psi.Pour into Petri dishes when it reaches 50 degrees Celsius (Approximately hot enough to hold the flask/ jar with one hand), and let it sit for 10 minutes. Do not stir the solution after taking it out of Autoclave, as this would lead to air bubbles being trapped in this solution.Once the Petri dishes are set, inoculate them and wrap them with parafilm. Keeping the plates aside for a week is recommended to check for contamination.Petri dishes are best to be stored upside down to avoid condensation.Do not have a pressure cooker? You can alsoMicrowave Sterilizeyour own containers or jars.You would need a reagent bottle to make agar. If made in a Microwave, a 500ml reagent bottle would fit. If using a Sterilizer, then a 1000ml reagent bottle should fit.We have relied on this Mix to experiment with different varieties in our lab.Check out our other listings to addmycelium culturesandpre-poured Agar plates.We also sell othermushroom-growing equipment.",

Do Not put in FreezerExpiration Standard:18 months from manufacture date,Storage Conditions:Shelf stable at room temperature; it also can be store in  fridge at 2°-8°C, keep away from direct lightIt is better to order this product on weekend so we can send it out on Monday to avoid delays on shipping.Plant Preservative Mixture (PPM™)is a versatile biocide specifically designed for plant tissue culture. It offers an effective solution to combat persistent microbial contamination from airborne, waterborne, and internal sources.When used alongside proper aseptic laboratory practices, PPM™ significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving successful and flourishing culture experiments.Advantages of Plant Preservative MixtureAt optimal concentrations, PPM™—short for Plant Preservative Mixture™—serves as a highly efficient preservative and biocide. Remarkably, it does not hinder in vitro processes like seed germination, callus formation, or regeneration.PPM™ inhibits the germination of bacterial and fungal spores. Its heat stability allows it to be autoclaved with the media.As a recommended standard component of plant tissue culture media, PPM™ is also more cost-effective compared to commonly used antibiotics.While primarily designed to prevent airborne, waterborne, and human-introduced contamination, PPM™ can often be utilized to mitigate endogenous contamination as well.PPM™ ensures that the plant’s genetic profile remains unaffected.Guidelines for Using Plant Preservative MixtureGeneral Dosage RecommendationsFor most types of contamination, excluding endogenous ones, the advised dosage ranges from 0.05% to 0.2%. Specifically, for processes like callus proliferation, organogenesis, and embryogenesis, a dosage between 0.05% and 0.075% is suggested. Higher concentrations of PPM™ may be required to address severe endogenous contamination.Managing Endogenous ContaminationFor explants:Submerge 1 cm (or smaller) explants in a 4-5% v/v PPM™ solution enriched with 3x MS basal salts (excluding Tween 20). Gently shake or stir them for 4-12 hours. Without rinsing, place the explants into a medium supplemented with 0.05-0.1% PPM™ for herbaceous plants or 0.2% PPM™ for woody species.Note:Instructions from sections 6(b) to 10 apply exclusively to ornamental plants.For tubers, bulbs, and scales:Begin by shaking or stirring the entire tuber, bulb, or scale in a bleach solution. Rinse thoroughly under non-sterile conditions, then slice into thin sections. Submerge these slices in a 4-5% PPM™ solution containing full-strength basal salts (without pH adjustment or Tween 20) for 12-24 hours. Without rinsing, transfer them to a medium enriched with 0.1-0.2% PPM™.This Product is also available in 500ml bottles. Reach out for larger sizes or recurring order arrangements.",

    "description": "DescriptionImportant-You can select the kit with colonisation lid and no colonisation lid.Colonisation lid are currently out of stock so we wanted to give people this option, the photos would still show the colonisation lid.Please note: Due to a shortage of supplies, the kit comes with adifferentliner. Just ensure you fold/cut your bin liner so that the side holes in the black base are not covered by your liner. Do not forget to spray your liner with iso propyl alcohol.We are glad to introduce our Max Yield Bins Mushroom Growing Kit to the professional growing community.Alternative kit to this one-Checkout our Inflatable monotub kit.This monotub has a capacity of 10 kg, accommodating 2 kg of spawn, 6 kg of substrate, and optionally 2 kg of casing. It is not recommended for beginners due to its large size and potential contamination loss. The tub’s robust construction is highlighted, making it durable but expensive to ship. The product is made in Canada and sold by LalaLab, the official reseller of Max Yield Bins.If you’re interested in our Max Yield Bins Mushroom Growing Kit without the substrate and spawn, please explore our listing for theMax Yield Monotub Kit. This option provides flexibility for experienced growers looking to customize their cultivation experience.Max Yield is the most sturdy, reusable, elegant, and heavy-duty monotub money can buy. This kit is an absolute beast, providing you with abundant mushrooms. We have grown Oysters in these tubs, including Giant King Oysters, Swordbelt, Shiitake, and Reishi.These tubs can also be used to fruit your mushroom growing kits, containing humidity while providing enough airflow. The material used in the build is not some cheap, delicate plastic; they are very thick-walled and sturdy. When you see one yourself, your first impression will definitely be how heavy-duty and large the tubs are.The kit comes with the option to choose either the Tapered Lid or Flat (stackable) lid. The Tapered Lid allows condensation built on the lid to slide through to the side of the tub so it does not fall on your mushrooms.The flat lid has the advantage of allowing you to stack multiple tubs on top of each other to grow a lot of mushrooms.The tub comes with plenty of options to build your perfect kit.1) You have the option to select the type of grain bag, which is either your Rye or Millets. All mushrooms prefer both grains, so choose any. Want to know which is the best grain for your mushroom growth?2) Then, you select the substrate, which is either coco coir or manure for poop-loving mushrooms (White button/Portobellos) or sawdust for wood-loving mushrooms (like Swordbelt, Shiitake, Reishi, Oysters, etc.).Coco and manure substrate come in 3 bags of 2 kg each, totalling 6 kg, whereas the wood substrate comes in 2 bags of 3 kg each, totalling 6 kg. Then, you select whether you need casing or not; all our kits come with sterilized casing. If you are growing a species like Portobello mushrooms, you would need pasteurized casing. Portobello mushrooms are really hard to grow and not for beginners. We suggest you only grow them when you have plenty of experience. You can leave a note for us to replace your casing with pasteurized casing at checkout.Your kit includes:2 kg of grain spawn bags(Rye or Millet)  and 6 kg of substrate with an option to choose a 2 kg casing layer.The tub also comes with a complete Max Yield Kit with a black base, colonization lid, liner, air filters, and the option to choose tapered or stackable flat fruiting lids.You will receive isopropyl alcohol (100 ml), an atomizer spray bottle, and micropore tape.What does not come with the kit?Gloves, masks, liquid culture, or spore syringes.Please watch our demonstration video for a complete guide on using these kits.Dimensions:Black base with colonization lid: L x W x H: 52 cm x 39 cm x 19 cmBlack base with stackable lid: L x W x H: 52 cm x 39 cm x 30 cmBlack base with tapered lid: L x W x H: 52 cm x 39 cm x 32 cmThe shipping weight of the kit is between 12-14 kg.Please get in touch with us if you want to replace uncolonizsd grain bags with colonised mushroom spawns. We can do this for an extra charge of $20(2 kg); the spawn needs to be in stock.These monotubs are not designed to be airtight .",

    "description": "DescriptionPlease use the bags upon arrival or within 2 weeks otherwise they will contaminateAre you aware that plants thrive in environments where CO2 levels are triple those found in the typical atmosphere?Our CO2 generator bags do more than just optimize CO2 levels in your grow room; they also facilitate the cultivation of Reishi mushrooms. One month after you begin using our CO2 bags, you will notice the emergence of Reishi antlers. This particular species of Reishi, indigenous to Australia, is selected for its unique characteristic of not releasing spores during fruiting within the bag. This feature ensures that your grow space remains clean, free from airborne spores.As they mature, the Reishi antlers in our CO2 bags will extend to the ends of the bag. Upon opening the bag, which increases air exchange, these antlers can potentially develop into a conk at their tips, the part typically responsible for spore production. However, we recommend harvesting the antlers when they reach the top of the bag and air drying them, without allowing the formation of a conk. This method avoids the release of spores,providing the same medicinal benefits as fully matured Reishi.This approach enables the safe and spore-free harvesting of Reishi antlers, enhancing your investment by boosting plant growth and offering a source of medicinal mushrooms.”Maximize Your Plant Growth with Our Advanced CO2 Cultivation BagEnhance the vitality and yield of your indoor garden with our CO2 Cultivation Bag. Inspired by the pioneering work of ExHale CO2 Bags, the original creators of this innovative cultivation solution, our product is designed to optimize the photosynthesis process in plants. This self-activated bag delivers a consistent flow of CO2, crucial for carbohydrate production, without the need for any maintenance or additional equipment.* Optimal CO2 Levels:Suitable for small to medium-sized grow spaces, our CO2 bag provides up to 1300 ppm of CO2, covering a 4×4 foot space efficiently. It sustains this output for 6 months, ensuring your plants consistently receive the CO2 they need for maximum growth.* Safe and Organic:Created with natural, safe ingredients, this bag is harmless for use around people, pets, and plants. It’s the perfect addition to both home gardens and professional greenhouses.* Maintenance-Free:Hang the bag above your plants, and it will release CO2 through its microporous surface—no manual intervention required.CO2 is heavier than air hence we want the bags to be kept above plant level.* Enhanced Plant Performance:By elevating CO2 levels, our bag aids your plants in photosynthesizing more effectively, which results in quicker growth, greater yields, and stronger overall health.* Continuous Operation:Our CO2 bag works around the clock, cultivating and releasing CO2 through a specialized porous patch that ensures a steady supply every day.* Visibility and Control:A clear window on the bag allows you to see the contents, helping you decide when it’s time for a replacement.* Locally Produced:Our CO2 bags are produced locally, reducing shipping times and providing you with a fresher, more effective product. The bags are inoculated just before dispatch. They will start producing CO2 roughly one week from dispatch.* Advanced Fungi Technology:Using a specific fungi strain and a specially formulated substrate, our bags produce an abundant amount of CO2 , extending the life and effectiveness of each bag.Longevity and Replacement Strategy:Our CO2 bags are engineered to last up to 6 months, providing a continuous and effective release of CO2. However, to ensure that your plants consistently receive optimal levels of CO2 for peak photosynthesis and growth, we recommend a strategic replacement schedule:* Initial Setup: Begin by placing one CO2 bag in your grow space. This bag will effectively enrich the environment with CO2.* Boosting CO2 Levels: After 3 months, add a second fresh CO2 bag to your grow space. This addition helps to boost the CO2 concentration, compensating for any gradual decrease in output from the first bag as it ages. This ensures that your plants consistently have access to high levels of CO2, which is essential for their growth.* Maintaining Consistency: At the 6-month mark, replace the first bag (which has now reached the end of its optimal effectiveness) with a new one. Keep the second bag, which will still be effective, in place. This staggered approach ensures there is never a drop in CO2 levels, which can affect plant health and yield.Do not forget to harvest the antlers from the bag before disposal.This intercalation strategy ensures that CO2 levels remain high and stable, providing your plants with the ideal environment for vigorous growth throughout their lifecycle.Experience enhanced growth and yields in your garden with our CO2 Cultivation Bag, designed for both vegetative growth and flowering stages, ensuring your plants thrive in their ideal growing conditions.Alternate ways to get CO2Using pure, liquefied carbon dioxide from pressurized tanks is a reliable but costly option that requires significant infrastructure and ongoing expenses. It involves complex safety measures and substantial space, making it less accessible for small-scale growers or those with limited space. Additionally, alternative methods like small burners consume 1kg of propane to produce 3kg of carbon dioxide, but this process also introduces water vapor, heat, and potentially unburned hydrocarbons, which can be detrimental in a controlled growing environment (Chalabi et al., 2002). These unwanted byproducts can disrupt the delicate balance required for optimal plant growth. On the other hand, CO2 bags offer a simpler, safer, and more cost-effective solution without the need for specialized infrastructure or the risk of hazardous byproducts, making them a more suitable choice for many indoor gardeners. For further reading on the complexities of using CO2 in controlled environments, the study byArizona Universityprovides comprehensive insights.",

Unicorn PP bags was tested at the highest levels of 121 C for 3.5 hours.  No PE bags or other manufacturers’ PP bags have achieved this important food safety criteria. So rest assured you are not getting any microplastics from our kits.Your bags are made to order; please allow 2 to 3 days of handling time.We recommend that the bags are used as soon as possible to minimize the chances of contamination.This product is excellent for growing any type of hardwood-loving mushrooms like lion’s mane, king oyster, shiitake, maitake, turkey tail, wood ear, and more.This product contains Hardwood chips along with sawdust. Hardwood chips give mycelium something substantial to hold into, and the mycelium grows really vigorously when it comes in contact with hardwood chips.

It essentially removes one of the most contamination-prone steps out of the mushroom growing process, saving a lot of hassle.Steps:The lower part of the bag consists of grains. Sanitize the injection port, Flame the needle until red, let it cool, and then inject the grains through the injection port with 10cc Liquid culture or a completely sterile spore syringe.Once inoculated, move the bag around without shaking. This helps the liquid to move around the bag and not settle at the bottom.Keep the bag in a dry and dark spot at around 24°c on average.Check the bag in one week or two when all the grains are colonized.Simply take the bag and shake it to mix the substrate and grains together. Be careful not to strain the top of the bag, which has been heat-sealed.Keep the bag again for a week in a dry and dark spot at 24°c.Ready to fruit as per your mushroom species- Some are top fruiting, and others are side fruiting.If you wish to purchaseSawdust and Bran substrateby itself, we have it available in our store.",

We can’t ship this at any cost as it breaks and leaks.If you wanted to buy a liquid culture toliquid culture expansion kitthat can be shipped we have the right product for you.These uncolonized liquid culture jars are sterile and contain the required nutrients, a magnetic stirrer, and a specialised mycology lid. They contain about 600 ml of extra-clear liquid in a 1-litre glass jar, and about 200 ml of extra-clear liquid in a 473-ml glass jar.Before being sold, these jars are left on the shelf for a fortnight to ensure no contamination is present.Brand:The specific brand of the jar might vary based on what’s available, so we can’t promise a particular one, but we aim to supply original, branded ball jars.Inoculation:Introduce a liquid culture or an agar wedge to the jar. But be aware that if you open the lid to insert an agar wedge, you can’t claim any contamination issues later. Please note that you shouldn’t directly introduce a spore syringe into these jars; even when tested, spore syringes might have minimal contamination.Observation Period:After inoculating, give it a week or two. You should observe mycelium growth resembling jelly while the remaining nutrient liquid remains clear.Visual Inspection:If you notice any haziness or cloudiness in the liquid, that’s a dead giveaway of contamination.Testing Before Use:To verify the culture’s purity, you might want to test it on an MEA plate or MEA cup. Just a heads up – don’t use an MEAG medium for testing.Injection Port:Before using the jar’s injection port, spray it with isopropyl alcohol. Always use a new needle for every injection, and avoid reusing needles even if you’ve flame-sterilised them. And remember, don’t stick a heated needle into the injection port. It needs to be cooled down.Looking to make your own liquid culture? Visit us atMake Liquid Culturefor a shopping list curated for beginners.",

    "description": "DescriptionThese Hardwood Pellets for Mushrooms or Hardwood Sawdust Fuel Pellets (HWFP) are an indispensable choice for serious mushroom cultivators and eco-conscious gardeners. These 15 kg hardwood fuel pellets are sourced responsibly from pristine Aussie forests; the wood pellets reflect our deep commitment to environmental stewardship.We ensure that our pellets are entirely free from harmful chemicals and additives, making them an ideal growing medium for a variety of gourmet mushrooms, including oyster, shiitake, and lion’s mane. The ease of use is a significant advantage – simply adding boiling water transforms them into a perfect, aerated substrate, allowing both beginners and seasoned growers to achieve impressive results.Beyond mushroom cultivation, these are best for BBQ  or Smoking use, burning cleaner and for longer durations than their softwood counterparts.For mushroom cultivation, the hardwood wood pellets can be used alone or in combination with other supplements like bran or soy pellets, depending on the specific needs of wood-loving mushroom species. When using bran, the recommended ratio is to add bran at 20% of the dry weight of the pellet mix. For instance, for every 5 kg of pellets, add 1 kg of bran. Along with this, add 2 liters of boiling water for each kilo of the total mix. In the case of making a Master Mix, the ratio is to mix equal parts of soy pellets and hardwood pellets. For every kilo of this mix, add 1.9 liters of water. These ratios ensure an optimal substrate composition for various mushroom growing requirements with the right field capacity.These pellets are better than the hardwood pellets Bunnings or mitre10.Check out ourMushroom Substratesfor more information.",
